<B> THE MEAN OF A ONE VARIABLE DATA SET</B></DIV>

The <B>mean</B> or <B>average</B> is a measure of central tendency for a continuous data set. This
measure can either be computed for a population or for a sample.  The <B>sample mean</B> is denoted
<!-- MATH
 $\overline{X}$

the sample mean is computed by adding up all the data and dividing by the total number of data
points.  Symbolically this is given by
<!-- MATH
 \begin{displaymath}
\overline{X} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n X_i}{n}
\end{displaymath}

The mean conveys a great deal of information.  First
of all it is a <B>central value</B>.  This signifies that the mean will be located towards the
center of the data.  As will be seen shortly the mean balances the total value above it and below
it.  Secondly it is a <B>clustering value</B>.  This indicates that the measurements tend to cluster
about the average.  The actual extent of this clustering can be measured in terms of measures of
variation. In line with this idea of clustering we would say that the mean is an <B>expected
value</B>.  That is, if a value is picked randomly from a set of data we would expect it to be close
to the mean.  This concept is used quite often in the way many everyday occurrences are viewed. 
For example if a basketball player averages 24 points per game then the value we would expect this
player to score in his next game would be 24.   Finally the mean has the
mathematical significance that the <B>deviations</B> from the mean sum to zero.  This is the
technical way of describing  that the mean balances the total value above and below it.  A
deviation of a measurement <IMG

 SRC="img6.gif"
 ALT="$ X_i$"> from the mean is the difference <!-- MATH
 $X_i - \overline {X}$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="57" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img7.gif"
 ALT="$ X_i - \overline {X}$">.  Thus a
deviation is positive if the measurement is larger than the mean and negative if it is smaller than
the mean.  That the sum of these is always zero can be expressed as ;

<P>
<!-- MATH
 \begin{displaymath}
\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \overline{X}) = 0

<B>EXAMPLE</B> Suppose the sample data
consisted of the five measurements 86,81,73,85,80 then the mean would be computed as
