<B>SAMPLE SIZE OF A ONE VARIABLE DATA SET</B></DIV>

The <B>sample size</B> of a one variable data set is simply the number of measurements in that data
set. Many statistical procedures differ depending on whether there is a <B>large sample</B> or a
<B>small sample</B>.  The <B>central limit theorem</B> which is a cornerstone of both applied
statistics and theoretical statistics says that many if not most populations can be approximated
for large sample size by a normal distribution.  Hence if the sample is <I>large enough</I> the
normal distribution approximation can be used. <I>Large enough</I> here means just that the results
gets better as the sample size gets larger.  In practice <IMG
 WIDTH="51" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.gif"
 ALT="$ n = 30$"> is taken as the cutoff between
large and small samples.  Thus a sample with <IMG
 WIDTH="51" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.gif"
 ALT="$ n \ge 30$"> can be consiidered a large sample and the
normal approximation used while if <IMG
 WIDTH="51" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.gif"
 ALT="$ n &lt; 30$"> it is a small sample and different procedures (
depending on the population itself) must be used.
