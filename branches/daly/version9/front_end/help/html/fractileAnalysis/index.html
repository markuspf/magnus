<B> FRACTILES OR QUANTILES FOR  A ONE VARIABLE DATA SET</B></DIV>

<P><P>

<P>
The mean and the median are measures of central tendency. That is they located, in one way or
another, the center of the data. Often it is desired to locate other positions as well.  A class of
measures which accomplishes this are the <B>fractiles</B>  or <B>quantiles</B>.  These are measures
which divide the total data into fractional sections.  The simplest quantile is the median which
divides the data in half.  That is the median is the measurement which is located so that 50% of
the data is less than or equal to it. 

<P>
If the data is divided into four parts we get the <B>quartiles</B>.  There are three quartiles
usually denoted <!-- MATH
 $Q_1,Q_2,Q_3$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="77" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.gif"
 ALT="$ Q_1,Q_2,Q_3$">.  The first quartile  <IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.gif"
 ALT="$ Q_1$"> is defined as that measurement located
so that 25% of the data is less than or equal to it.  The second quartile  <IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.gif"
 ALT="$ Q_2$"> is the same as
the median.  The third quartile  <IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.gif"
 ALT="$ Q_3$"> is the measurement located so that 75% of the data is less
than or equal to it. 

<P>
EXAMPLE 

<P></P>

<P>
A demographic survey in a certain state indicates the the first and third quartiles in height for
adult women are 62 inches and 67 inches respectively.  This indicates that 25% of the adult women
in this state are 62 inches or less while 75% are 67 inches or less.

The median used the 50% point to define it while the quartiles used 25% pieces, but any fraction
or percent could be used to define a fractile.  Two common fractiles that are employed are the
<B>deciles</B> which divide the data into 10% chunks and the <B>percentiles</B> which divide the
data into 1% pieces.  In the former case there are nine deciles <!-- MATH
 $D_1,D_2,...,D_9$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.gif"
 ALT="$ D_1,D_2,...,D_9$">.  For
example, <IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img7.gif"
 ALT="$ D_6$"> would be the measurement located so that 60% of the data lies less than or equal
to it.  The others would be defined analagously.  <IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.gif"
 ALT="$ D_5$"> would coincide with the median.  For the
percentiles there are 99 such measurements denoted <!-- MATH
 $P_1,....P_99$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="72" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.gif"
 ALT="$ P_1,....P_99$">.  The 86th percentile, <IMG
 WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img10.gif"
 ALT="$ P_{86}$">
would be located so that 86% of the data is less than or equal to it.  It should be noted that 
<IMG
 WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img11.gif"
 ALT="$ P_{25}$"> is the same as the first quartile and <IMG
 WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img12.gif"
 ALT="$ P_{75}$"> is the same as the third quartile.  

<P>
EXAMPLE 

<P></P>

<P>
In the same study cited in the previous example it was found that the 95th percentile in height
was 70 inches.  This would indicate that 95% of the adult women were 70 inches or less. 
Equivalently only 5% were above this height.
