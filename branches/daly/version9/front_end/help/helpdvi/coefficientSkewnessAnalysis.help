About Skewness

  An important characteristic of a population is its symmetry or lack of symmetry . Lack of symmetry is called skew. Many inferential statistical procedures depend on the data being fairly symmetrical and therefore the presence of skew becomes an important concept. The relationship betwen the mean and median can be used to describe these concepts.
