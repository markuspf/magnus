 PREREQUISITES
 -------------

 For MAGNUS you need  Tcl/Tk 8.x (see http://dev.scriptics.com/). 
   Please do consider upgrading to at least Tcl/Tk 8.3.3.

 In order to compile MAGNUS:
     - gcc distribution with Fedora Core 1, 2, or 3, or gcc 3.3+, has been successfully 
       tested. A previous version working with gcc 2.95.3 is also available.

     - GNU make 3.71 or higher. Earlier/other version of make MAY NOT WORK.
  
     - 64 MB of swap space and 150 MB of disk space for compilation
       of magnus


 INSTALLATION STEPS
 -------------------

 To compile  MAGNUS:

   1) Let magnus_xx_xx_xx  be the MAGNUS' archive name.

      Unpack MAGNUS archive:
          $ tar xvfz magnus_xx_xx_xx.tgz 
      It should create a directory with the source code. Below $magnus will
      refer to this directory.

   2) Run $magnus/Configure script. The script will ask for
      verification that the current directory is correct, and then ask for 
      the path to the tcl executable "wish". (You should verify the path of 
      your wish executable by typing the command, "which wish", and then 
      answer with the path that the "which wish" command gave you.) 

   3) Change to the $magnus directory. Type:
         $ make 
      To compile the package. This can take about 20 minutes on a Pentium III
       machine.
      There is nothing to worry about when make complains of missing
      .d files; it generates them itself.

   4) To invoke magnus type:
         $ $magnus/front_end/magnus.

   5) If you want to save space run 
         $ $magnus/make realclean
      If you want to keep source files do 
         $ $magnus/make mostlyclean

 If you installing precompiled version:

    1) Let magnus_xx_xx_xx  be the MAGNUS' archive name.

      Unpack MAGNUS archive:
          $ tar xvfz magnus_xx_xx_xx.tgz 
      It should create a directory with the source code. Below $magnus will
      refer to this directory.

   2) Run $magnus/Configure script. The script will ask for
      verification that the current directory is correct, and then ask for 
      the path to the tcl executable "wish". (You should verify the path of 
      your wish executable by typing the command, "which wish", and then 
      answer with the path that the "which wish" command gave you.) 

   3) To invoke magnus type:
         $ $magnus/front_end/magnus.

 NOTE:

 If you later change the location of $magnus directory, you need not recompile, 
 but you must run $magnus/Configure again.
