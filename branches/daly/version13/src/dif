< The following is a list of participants and contributors who have
< donated time, expertise, and software to the Magnus project.
---
> This project, entitled Magnus, was started almost six years ago
> by Gilbert Baumslag, with the help of C.F. Miller III and Hamish
> Short. The latter two played a major role in the planning and
> initial development of Magnus. It is appropriate to say that
> this software would not have been produced without them.
> There are many other people who have contributed to Magnus in 
> an essential way. These contributors have been divided up into 
> groups, listed alphabetically. The first group consists of people 
> who have worked extensively on Magnus, while the second involves 
> people who have contributed software, ideas and know-how. At
> present the chief programmer is Dmitri Bormotov, who can be
> reached at bormotov@rio.sci.ccny.cuny.edu.
