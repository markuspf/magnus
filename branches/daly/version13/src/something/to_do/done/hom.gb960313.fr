Status: to print and discuss


1.

Domain is free:

m1 extends to a homomorphism: this follows from the fact that the given 
generators freely generate F1.

Otherwise:

m1 doesn't extend to a homomorphism: the images of the generators do not 
satisfy the given relations.

Status:
	 


2.

h1 is the homomorphism of F1 to F1, defined on the generators of F1 as
follows:  a -> a^2, b -> b^2.

h1 is the extension of m1 to a homomorphism of F1 to F1, defined on the 
generators of F1 as follows:  a -> a^2, b -> b^2.

Status: done, but needs a discussion
Changed to "The extension of m1 to a homomorphism of F1 to F1:..."

that the images of the generators do not satisy the given relations. 

m1 doesn't extend to a homomorphism: this follows by making use of
the cyclic  decomposition.
