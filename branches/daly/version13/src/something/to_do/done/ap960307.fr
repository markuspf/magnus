Hello Dima,

Here is the wording for the dialogue box:

Check-in the two factors, their respective subgroups
and the map that defines the purported isomorphism
between these subgroups. Then highlight these five
"objects" and choose "An amalgamated product" in the 
make menu.

G

Check-in the two factors and their respective subgroups, which must
have the same number of generators. The generators of the two
subgroups must be arranged so that the mapping which sends the n-th
generator of the first subgroup to the n-th generator of the second
subgroup defines an isomorphism between them. (Note: amalgamated
products are, as of now, only implemented when the factors are checked
in as free.)
