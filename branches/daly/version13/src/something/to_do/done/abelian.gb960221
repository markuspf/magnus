Found the cyclic decomposition of A1:  Z^3.  

The cyclic decomposition allows one to solve a number of algorithmic problems, for example the word problem, the order problem and so on.

___________________________________________________

A1 is not trivial:  this follows from the cyclic decomposition of A1.

--------------------------------------------------

A1 is infinite:  this follows from the cyclic decomposition of A1.

Is A1 free abelian?

________________________________________________

A1 is free abelian: this follows from the cyclic decomposition of A1.

_________________________________________________

The order of A1 is infinite: this follows from the cyclic decomposition of A1.

The torsion-free rank of A1 is 3: this follows from the cyclic decomposition of A1.

w2 is not trivial in A2 : this follows from the canonical decomposition.


The order of w2 is infinite: this follows from the canonical decomposition.

H1 is not equal to A2: this follows by computing 
the abelian invariants of A2/H1.


A2 is infinite: this follows by computing the torsion-free rank of A2.
