Questions about subgroups:

Is H1 trivial
Compute the order of H1
Compute the torsion-free rank of H1
Compute the order of the torsion subgroup of H1
_________________________________________________

Is H1 = A2
Find the index of H1 in A2
Find a virtual complement of H1 in A2
Is H1 isolated in A2
Is H1 pure in A2

In the isomorphism problem, the answer should be: A1 and A2
are not isomorphic - they have different torsion-free ranks.

The message that comes up when dealing with an abelian group
should read:

The cyclic decomposition allows one to solve a number of algorithmic problems,
for example the word problem, the order problem and so on. In working with 
such a decomposition, we use additive notation, denoting the generators 
of the infinite cyclic summands in the canonical decomposition of an 
abelian group, by f_1, f_2, .. , and those of the finite cyclic summands, 
by t_1, t_2, ... . The orders of t_1, t_2, ... are arranged so that the order
of t_1 divides that of t_2, the order of t_2 divides that of t_3, ... and 
so on.

When one asks Magnus whether a map from the generators of an abelian group
into the group itself defines a homomorphism, the answer that comes up should
read: m1 does not extend to a homomorphism: this follows from the fact
that the images of the given generators do not satisfy the defining relations
of A1. Same is true for a map from A1 to A2. 

When a map does extend to a homomorphism, has been fixed for finitely
presented groups, but what about abelian groups?

In using Make, in Define a set of words, the Instruction should read:

Enter a set of additional relators.

The Quick Help should read:

Enter the additional relators as words in the generators of the ...
(add "additional")


When checking whether two words are equal, one needs to say  ... follows from
their canonical decompositions.
*******************

We also need here various questions involving homomorphisms, how to
compute their composition, whether they are surjections, equal and
so on including all of the stuff we talked about for orindary homomorphisms
of one group into another.
