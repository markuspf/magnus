1. FE: In FreeGroup the item "Is trivial" has to call "freely reduce" 
   instead of word problem window.

2. We've got 3 improuvement for Whitehead stuff.

   1) I can abelianize a word, and if gcd of powers is non equal 1,
      this element is not primitive.

   2) If exponential sum for all generators is equal 0, this element
      is also not primitive.

   3) If exponential sum for some generator is equal 1, we can cancel
      all other generators.

1. Rewriting system for FPGroups which is free - should be discussed
   with Gilbert - it is Ilja's advice.
