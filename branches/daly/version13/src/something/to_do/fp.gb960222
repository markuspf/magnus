G1 is not trivial: this follows because its abelianization
is non-trivial.

G1 is infinite: this follows because the torsion-free rank
of its abelianisation is non-zero.

*******G1 is infinite: the free abelian rank is positive.

This should be replaced by:

G1 is infinite: this follows by computing the torsion-free rank
of the abelianisation of G1.   

When we check to see if a presentation is a metric
small cancellation presentation, the answer, if there are
no pieces, should read:

The presentation of G1 is metric small cancellation; there are
no non-trivial pieces.
