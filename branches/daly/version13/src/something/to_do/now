1. Need to have Define2Int procedure or it's equivalent in front end.
   Think about the situation in general.( I.e. a window with several
   fields of different types.)

2. Provide necessary front end implementation for quadratic equations.
   Please think in general again: listboxes, file viewers with
   possibility to create objects.

3. Need to implement interface between SM and FE to allow free
   changing of names of SM Objects.

4. ParseErroMessage is not convienent to use.

5. Sander's complaints.
