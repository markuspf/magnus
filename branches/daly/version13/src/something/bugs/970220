1. from @am: It's difficult to suspend a problem with yellow light on it.

2. from @gb:

Magnus cannot construct an am. product if 

F1 = <a,b>,
F2 = <c,d>,
S1 = { [a,b], [a^2,b], a[a^3,b], b[a^4,b] }
S2 = { d[c^2,d], c[c^2,d], [c^3,d], [c^4,d] }

3. from @am:

Deleting a working conjugacy problem object for a FP group will crash
the system.

>@db:

The current implementation has to be changed because

1. It can crash.
2. It MSC CM cannot help the problem will stop anyway.
