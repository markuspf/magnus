User defined free group:
F1 = < x, y  >.


User defined word in the generators of F1:
w1 = x y X.


Checked in the problem "Part of basis ?".

The problem "Part of basis ?" started
Tue Mar 19 14:12:11 EST 1996.

w1 is part of the free basis ( x y x^-1, x ).

The problem "Part of basis ?" finished
Tue Mar 19 14:12:11 EST 1996.

User defined nilpotent quotient of class 2 of F1:
G1 = < x, y >.


Checked in the problem "G1 abelian ?".

The problem "G1 abelian ?" started
Tue Mar 19 14:13:31 EST 1996.

Computed the nilpotent structure of G1; This allows for solving the word problem, computing the center, and computing centralizers.

The problem "Aut struct" started
Tue Mar 19 14:14:27 EST 1996.

Started KBmag, reference number 12, with ShortLex ordering (the specific ordering is not yet accessible; we're working on it!)

The KBmag with reference number 12 has succeeded.

Have a ShortLex automatic structure for G1, discovered by KBMAG, Version 1.2.

G1 is infinite: by counting the language of the word acceptor.

Have a fast solution of the word problem for G1: the automatic structure.

The problem "Aut struct" finished

%% It seems that here Magnus uses the old group G1 rather than its nilpotent quotient. This has to be changed.

Checked in Problem_1.

Problem_1 started
Tue Mar 19 14:18:34 EST 1996.

Problem_1 finished
Tue Mar 19 14:18:34 EST 1996.
%% The next problem was to compute the nilpotent structure for G1.
A more detailed answer than the one above is necessary.
