User defined finitely presented group:
G1 = < x, y ; x^y = x^2 >.


Solved the word problem for G1: the presentation is one-relator

User defined word in the generators of G1:
w1 = x.
User defined word in the generators of G1:
w2 = x^8.

w1 and w2 are conjugate: w1 ? = ? w2, where ? = x y x y

Session Manager started.

Bootstrap complete.

User defined finitely presented group:
G1 = < x, y, z ; x^2=1, z^2=1, y^2=1 >.


Have a fast solution of the word problem for G1: by Dehn's algorithm

G1 is infinite: by a lemma of D. Bormotov, D. Pechkin on C'(1/6) groups

The presentation of G1 is C'(00)

The system requires a confluent rewriting system for G1 before it can start to compute its homology.

Problem_1 started

Started Rutgers Knuth-Bendix Package, reference number 7, with lenlex ordering (the specific ordering is not yet accessible; we're working on it!)

The rkbp with reference number 7 has succeeded

Have a confluent rewrite system for G1, discovered by the Rutgers Knuth-Bendix Package, Version 1.25

G1 is infinite: by counting the language of irreducible words

Have a fast solution of the word problem for G1: the confluent rewrite system

Warning: Magnus currently executes the Rutgers Knuth-Bendix Package *synchronously*. This means that Magnus will appear to freeze if rkbp takes a long time to respond. We are working on an asynchronous version.
