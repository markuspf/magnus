Dear Professor,

This is the homework (that you gave last class) I have in my notes:

Question 1.
Let Mod(Gamma) = {M | for all phi \in Gamma, M |= phi}
Let Gamma |= psi iff Mod(Gamma) \subseteq Mod(psi)
Show that if Gamma1 \subseteq Gamma2 then Mod(Gamma2) \subseteq
Mod(Gamma1)

Question 2.
Show by calculation:
1) (2,25) |= K_p (\neg P)
2) (2,25) |= K_s K_p (\neg P)
3) (2,12) |= K_p (\neg P)
4) (2,12) |= \neg K_s(K_p(\neg P))

Question 3.
W0 = { (a,b) | 2 <= a <= b <= 100 }
W1 = set after Product's first announcement
        { (a,b) | a, b are not both primes }
W2 = set after Sum's first announcement
        { (a,b) | a+b is odd and a+b-2 is not a prime }
W3 = set after Product's second announcement
W4 = .......................................
Calculate W3 and W4.

I also have it as LaTeX and PostScript files.

Thank You.

Sincerely,

Mikhail Kunin
