Magnus 1.3.3.

1. This Magnus version contans Whitehead stuff for an arbitrary set of
words, for convienence in case of a free group I provided a separate
object SetOfWords which has to be constructed to run Whitehead.

2. The general problem object "Is abelian ?" is implemented in case of
a finitely presented group.

3. The general problem object "Is nilpotent ?" is implemented in case
of a finitely presented group. After couple of experiments I've
understood that in case when nilpotency class is too big the ARCs are
big too, so this problem object requires additional ARCing and cannot
be considered as complete now.
