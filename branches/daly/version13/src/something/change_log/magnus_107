Magnus Version 1.0.7

1. COPYRIGHT menu item is fixed.

2. Abelian group menu is cleaned up.

3. Pull-down menu items was moved apart a little bit.

4. Implemented new dialog in tcl script which allows to enter
   arbitrary set of words. Using this dialog I wrote new interface
   classes for Make menu item "Make a quptient".
