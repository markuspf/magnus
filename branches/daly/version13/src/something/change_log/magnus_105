Version 1.0.5 beta.

02/02/96

1. Implemented new interface classes and menu items for Nilpotent
   Groups, using Sergei's back end code:
	
   Is G1 abelian ?
   Compute the order of G1.
   Is w1 of finite order in G1 ?
   Is H1 trivial ?
   Is H1 abelian ?
   Is H1 finite ?
	
   We don't have anything new to implement for Nilpotent Groups now.

2. Fixed CM NilpotentWordProblem: early the answer wasn't printed in
   the object view window.

3. Added some preliminary checkings in Whitehead algorithm.

4. Chuck's complaint about troubles with permissions.

5. Worked with bugs of KBmagPackage, some are fixed. I need to discuss
   the situation with this package, because not everything is ok here.

6. Made new menu item "Make", provided all necessary tools for
   comunication between SM and FE to make possible addition of
   new items.

7. Implemented new interface classes and menu items for Make menu:

   Make Abelian quotient of G1
        Nilpotent quotient of G1
