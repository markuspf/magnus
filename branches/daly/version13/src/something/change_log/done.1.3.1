Magnus version 1.3.1.

1. This version of Magnus works under tcl7.4/tk4.0 nicely, I think I
   finished the porting at last.

2. Amalgamated Products:

   For a group:

     Is G1 trivial ?
     Is G1 finite ?
     Is G1 abelian ?
     Compute the order of G1

     * This four algorithms can be eliminated easily, but I want to
       discuss this first, because we keep many such menu items for
       another kind of groups.

   For a word:
 
     Compute the reduced form of w1
     Compute the normal form of w1
     Compute the cyclic normal form of w1
     Is w1 trivial ?


   For a subgroup:

     Is S1 trivial ?


   For two words:
     
     Is w1 equal to w2 ?

3. Subgroup triviality problem object was implemented for abelian,
   small cancellation and finitely presented groups. Also I made such
   fast problem object for a free group, but maybe it doesn't make too
   much sence (need to discuss). This problem is alredy done for
   nilpotent groups.

   * I need to discuss the order and structure of all subgroup menu
     items.

4. Fixing.

  1) Normal Closure was removed from the order of an element problem for
     abelian groups.

  2) A couple of items was removed or commented out.

  3) The menu item that allows to check in an amalgamated product is
     available now.
