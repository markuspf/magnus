1. G -> H, if( G.numOfGens == 0 || H.numOfGens == 0 ) we can extent to
   hom, right ?

2. In case -> Free should I check all relators as well ?

3. Can we somehow optimize the case Nilpotent -> Abelian -> Nilpotent ?

1. I should change free to free abelian, what about the title
   "Freeness problem" ?
