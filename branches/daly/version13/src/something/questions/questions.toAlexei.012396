1. Is trivial for free groups doesn't make sence, right ?

2. Is A1 metabelian ? Not for 2-nilpotent ??? For nilpotent ?

3. Is A1 metric small cancellation? What about abelian and nilpotent ?
   What if some nilpotent group will have big rank ?

4. I added the item "Is G1 hyperbolic ?" for !free and !MSC, is it
   correct ?

5. For Nilpotent Groups I can use origin set of relators (without 
   commutators) when I want to compute the abelianization.

6. What text exactly should be in homology item ?  Compute the
   integral homology groups of G1 ? (Sometimes we ask about
   dimension.)

7. In General Order Problem shoud I include Rewriting System and 
   Automatic Structure ?
