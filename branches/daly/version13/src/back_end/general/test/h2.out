The running time for the extractMax: 
d - arity of the heap, 
time is in seconds, 
the array contained 1 million numbers in reversed order, 
namely 999999, 999998, ..., 0,
extractMax has been called 100000 times: 

d = 2    time elapsed: 0.563652
d = 3    time elapsed: 0.436172
d = 4    time elapsed: 0.393798    The best time

Same experiment except that the array is filled with random values
from 0 to 999999 (still d = 4 is the best):

d = 2    time elapsed: 0.601835
d = 3    time elapsed: 0.503277
d = 4    time elapsed: 0.453177    The best time
