The running time for the heapsort: d - arity of the heap, time is in
seconds, the array contained 1 million numbers in reversed order, namely
999999, 999998, ..., 0:

d = 2    time elapsed: 5.32379
d = 3    time elapsed: 4.1964
d = 4    time elapsed: 3.84316   Almost the best time
d = 5    time elapsed: 4.06552
d = 6    time elapsed: 4.02322
d = 7    time elapsed: 3.98241
d = 8    time elapsed: 3.96183
d = 9    time elapsed: 3.84183   The best time
d = 10   time elapsed: 3.89611
d = 11   time elapsed: 3.94848
d = 12   time elapsed: 3.93113
d = 13   time elapsed: 3.89231
d = 14   time elapsed: 3.86574
d = 15   time elapsed: 3.94964
d = 16   time elapsed: 4.06111
d = 17   time elapsed: 4.14261
d = 18   time elapsed: 4.23587
d = 19   time elapsed: 4.32212
d = 20   time elapsed: 4.40752


Same experiment except that the array is filled with random values
from 0 to 999999 (d = 4 is the best):

d = 2    time elapsed: 6.27961
d = 3    time elapsed: 4.9043
d = 4    time elapsed: 4.5854    The best time
d = 5    time elapsed: 4.78812
d = 6    time elapsed: 4.69766
d = 7    time elapsed: 4.69784
d = 8    time elapsed: 4.72515
