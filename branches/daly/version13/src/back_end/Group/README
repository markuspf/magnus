  Beware that much of the code in this directory is `dead'. That is,
our paradigm has shifted away from the pedestrian `class hierarcy --
member function -- data member' scheme for computing, storing, and
sharing information about a group-theoretic entity.
  Thus almost all of the `intelligence' will be removed from these
classes at some point. They will become only representations of the
end user definition of the entity. So, e.g., an FPGroup will have the
print names of the generators, the relator set, and methods for, e.g.,
printing a word in the generators.
  But certain straightforward functions, like Dehn's algorithm, may as
well stay in this hierarchy.
