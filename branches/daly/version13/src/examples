Sasha,

These examples were collected by Romankov and Alexei G. Miasnikov. They are
the ones to be put into the database. The other file that I have sent you
is a sample of how these examples might be set up. It still needs work,
but see if you can make sense of it and try to use the same format for
a few other examples to see if this works (if you can make enough sense 
of the other ones). Once we get the format right, we can start on the 
task of putting them into the database. The key words and the method of
referring to these and the additional examples that we will ultimately
include will also have to be thought about.

 {\bf Key words:} {\it metabelian group, conjugacy separability, 
finite rank group, matrix group, minimax group}.


{\bf 1.Property.}  G is not conjugacy separable.

{\bf 3.Description.} (1) Let $A_{1} \simeq A_{2} \simeq {\bf Q}_{(p)} = \{ 
m/p^{k} | m,k\in {\bf Z}\}- p$-adic fraction group ($p$ prime), $B_{1} \simeq 
B_{2} \simeq {\bf Z}, A=A_{1} \times A_{2}, B= B_{1} \times B_{2},
G$ is an extension of $ A$  by $B$ : for any $a \in A $ some fixed elements $1 
\neq  a_{i} \in A_{i} (i=1,2),$
some generators $b_{i} \in B_{i}  (i=1,2)   b_{2}^{-1}ab_{2}=a^{p}, 
b_{1}^{-1}a_{2}b_{1}=a_{1}a_{2},
b_{1}^{-1}a_{1}b_{1}=a_{1}.$

(2) $G \leq GL_{3}(\bf Q_{(p)})$ is generated by matrices 

 
$$a_{1}=\pmatrix{1&0&1\cr
                 0&1&0\cr
                 0&0&1\cr},
a_{2}=\pmatrix{1&1&0\cr
                 0&1&0\cr
                 0&0&1\cr},
b_{1}=\pmatrix {1&0&0\cr
                  0&1&1\cr
                  0&0&1\cr},
b_{2}=\pmatrix{1/p&0&0\cr
                 0&1&0\cr
                 0&0&1\cr}$$
matching to the elements above.

{\bf 4.Explanation.} $a_{2} \not\sim _{G} a_{2}a_{1}^{1/p}$  as for 
$g=b_{1}^{k}b_{2}^{m}a$  one has
$g^{-1}a_{2}g=a_{1}^{kp^{m}}a_{2}^{p^{m}} (k,m \in {\bf Z})$.

For $N\unlhd G, |G:N|<\infty , |A:A\cap N|\not\vdots  p$ as $A$ is
$p$-divisible, then for some $s\in {\bf Z}  
 a_{1}^{1/p}N=a_{1}^{s}N$ \ 
and so $a_{2}N\sim _{G/N}  a_{2}a_{1}^{1/p}N$ by $b_{1}^{s}N$.  

{\bf 5.Additional properties.} $G$ is torsion free.
Finitely generated subgroups of $G$ 
are not finite separable in general. For example, the element
$a_{1}^{1/p}$ does not lie in the subgroup $H={\it gp}(a_{1})$ but 
$a^{1/p}\in HN $ for every $N\unlhd G, |G:N|<\infty .$

{\bf 6.Contrasts.} 1) Every finite generated metabelian group
is residually finite [P.Hall, On the finiteness of certain soluble groups.
Proc.London Math.Soc.9(1959), 595-622]. 

2) Every polycyclic group is conjugacy separable [ N.Blackburn, Conjugacy in 
nilpotent groups.

{\bf 3.Description.} $G=<a,b | a=[a,a^{b}]>=<b,x | xb^{2}xbx=bx^{2}b>,$ where
$a=bx$.

{\bf 4.Explanation.} The element $bx\not= 1$ lies in every term of the derived

Non-tame automorphisms of free nilpotent groups. Comm.Algebra

3619-3631.

{\bf 3.Description.} Every automorphism or primitive system of elements
of $M_{nk}$ can be lifted to such one of $N_{nk}$. So, assume that $G=M_{nk}$.
The primitive system $g=(g_{1}=[x_{1},x_{3},x_{3}]x_{1}, g_{2}=x_{2},
g_{4}=x_{4},..., g_{n}=x_{n})$, where $x=(x_{1},...,x_{n})$ is a standard
base of $G$, is non-tame. Hence an automorphism $\varphi \in AutM_{nk}$
such that $x_{i}^{\varphi}=g_{i} (i=1,2,4,...,n)$ is non-tame.

{\bf 4.Explanation.} It is sufficient to prove that $g$ is not induced by
some primitive system of elements of $M_{n}$, free metabelian group with
standard base $x'=(x_{1}',...,x_{n}')$ matching to $x$. If $g$ is induced
then there exists a base of $M_{n}$ of type 
$g'=(g_{1}'=w_{1}[x_{1},x_{3},x_{3}]x_{1}, g_{2}'=w_{2}x_{2}', 
g_{3}'=u_{3}x_{3}', g_{4}'=w_{4}x_{4}',...,g_{n}'=w_{n}x_{n}')$
where $w_{i} \in \gamma _{4}M_{n}, u_{3}' \in M_{n}'$. The map
$x_{i}'\mapsto g_{i}' (i=1,...,n) $ defines an automorphism of $M_{n}$.
By theorem from [ S.Bachmuth, Automorphisms of free metabelian group.
Trans.Amer.Math.Soc. 118(1965), 93-104 ] it is equivalent to invertibility of a
matrix $J(\varphi )=(\delta x_{i}'^{\varphi}/\delta x_{j}')$, where
$\delta /\delta x_{j}'$ are free Fox differentials of $M_{n}$ with values in 
${\bf Z}A_{n}={\bf Z}M_{n}/M_{n}'$. Denote $a_{i}=x_{i}'M_{n}'$,$b_{i}=a_{i}-1
(i=1,...,n)$.

Then

$$J(\varphi )=\pmatrix{1+b_{3}^{2}+\pi _{11}&\pi 
_{12}&-b_{1}b_{3}+\pi_{13}&\ldots&\pi_{1n}\cr
\pi_{21}&1+\pi_{22}&\pi_{23}&\ldots&\pi_{2n}\cr
\pi _{31}^{*}& \pi _{32}^{*}& 1+\pi _{33}^{*}&\ldots&\pi _{3n}^{*}\cr
\vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\cr
\pi _{n1}&\pi _{n2}&\pi _{n3}&\ldots&1+\pi _{nn}\cr}$$

where $\pi _{ij}=\delta w_{i}/\delta x_{j}' \in \Delta _{n}^{3}, $
$\pi _{3j}^{*}=\delta u_{3}/\delta x_{j}' \in \Delta _{n}$ ($\Delta _{n}$ 
augmentation
ideal of ${\bf Z}A_{n}$). Let $\lambda _{3}:{\bf Z}A_{n}\rightarrow {\bf 
Z}A_{n}$
 be a specialization map defined as $a_{3}\mapsto a_{3} , a_{i} \mapsto 1 
(i\not= 3).$
Then $detJ(\varphi)^{\lambda _{3}}=1+b_{3}^{2}+b_{3}^{3}\pi , \pi \in {\bf 
Z}A_{n}^{\lambda ^{3}}$,
is not invertible, hence $J(\varphi)$ is not invertible too, $\varphi$ is not 
automorphism.

{\bf 5.Additional properties.}

{\bf 6.Contrasts.} Every automorphism of a free abelian group $A_{n}$ of rank 
$n$,
 or a group $N_{n2}$, or a group $M_{n2}$ is tame. Every primitive system of
$m\leq n-2$ elements in $M_{nk}$ for every $k$, or in $N_{nk}$ for $k\leq 3$ is
tame {\bf [GGR]}.





{\bf Finitely presented metabelian group whose group of automorphisms is 
infinitely generated}

{\bf 0.Group.} Finitely presented metabelian ($G$).

{\bf Key words:} {\it metabelian group, automorphism group,
finite generality.}

{\bf 1.Property.} The automorphism group $AutG$ is not finitely generated.

{\bf 2.References.[L]} J.Lewin, A finitely presented group whose group of
automorphisms is infinitely generated. J.London Math.Soc. 42(1967),
610-613.

{\bf 3.Description.} Define $G$ as the extension of the group
$A={\bf Q_{(2)}}\times {\bf Q_{(2)}}$, where ${\bf Q_{(2)}}=\{ m/2^{n}|m,n\in 
{\bf Z}\}$
is the group of dyadic fractions, by automorphisms defined by matrices 

$$
t_{1}=\pmatrix{2&0\cr
0&2\cr},t_{2}=\pmatrix{1&0\cr
1&1\cr}.$$


So, $G$ is an extension of $A$ by $T={\it gp}(t_{1},t_{2})$. 
$G=<a_{1},a_{2},t_{1},t_{2}|
[a_{1},a_{2}]=1, [t_{1},t_{2}]=1, a_{1}^{t_{1}}=a_{1}^{2}, 
a_{2}^{t_{1}}=a_{2}^{2},
a_{1}^{t_{2}}=a_{1}, a_{2}^{t_{2}}=a_{1}a_{2}>$.

{\bf 4.Explanation.} An automorphism $\varphi \in AutA $ can be lifted to an 
automorphism 
$\bar {\varphi}\in AutG$ iff $\varphi$ lies in the subgroup generated by 
$t_{1},t_{2}$
and $s_{\alpha}=\pmatrix{1&0\cr
                         \alpha&1\cr} (\alpha \in {\bf Q_{(2)}}).$
There exists a projection of $AutG$ to $AutA$ with image $H={\it gp}(t_{1}, 
t_{2},s_{\alpha}|\alpha \in {\bf Q_{(2)}})$. As the group $H$ is not finitely 
generated, the group
$AutG$ is also not finitely generated.

{\bf 5.Additional properties.} $G$ has a finite rank.

{\bf 6.Contrasts.} The automorphism group of each finitely generated nilpotent 
group
or more generally of each polycyclic group is finitely generated ( in fact 
finitely
presented )[ L.Auslander, The automorphism group of polycyclic group. Ann.Math.
89(1969), 314-322].

{\bf 0.Group.} One-relator group defined by a commutator ($G$).

groups defined by positive words. Math.Proc.Camb.Phil.Soc. 93(1983),

{\bf 3.Description.} Define $G=<a,b| [a,v]=1>$, where $v=[a,b][w,w^{b}],
w=[a,b]^{-1}[a,b]^{a}.$

{\bf 4.Explanation.} It follows that $[a,b]^{a}[w,w^{b}]^{a}=[a,b][w.w^{b}],
$ , hence the element $w=[a,b]^{-1}[a,b]^{a}=[w,w^{b}][[w,w^{b}]^{a}]^{-1}\not= 
1$ lies in every term of the derived series of $G$.

{\bf 5.Additional properties.} $G$ is not free-by-cyclic group.

{\bf 6.Contrasts.} If $u$ and $v$ are positive words in generators 
$x_{1},...,x_{n}$ then the group  $K=<x_{1},...,x_{n}| [u,v]=1>$ is
 free-by-cyclic and therefore residually solvable [ G.Baumslag, Free
subgroups of certain one-relator groups defined by positive words.

{\bf 3.Description.} Let $T=<x,y|x^{2}=y^{3}>$ be the trefoil group.
It is known [ M.Dunwoody, Relation modules.
 Bull.London 
Math.Soc.
4(1972),151-155] that there exists a decomposition of $M={\bf Z}G\oplus
{\bf Z}G=C\oplus B$ where $C\simeq {\bf Z}G$ and $B$ cannot be generated 
(as a $G$-module) by a single element. It follows that $M$ cannot
be generated by two elements, one of which lies in $B$. Sure, $M$ has
two standard generators $m_{1},m_{2}$.  Let $\theta :F_{n-1}\rightarrow
G$ be any epimorphism. Define an action of $F_{n-1}$ on $M$ by $m^{f}=
m^{f^{\theta}} (m\in M, f\in F_{n-1})$. It follows that $M$ cannot be generated 
as $F_{n-1}-$module by two elements one of which lies in $B$.

Form a group $W$ as an extension of $M$ by $F_{n-2}={\it 
gp}(y_{1},...,y_{n-2})$,
which cannot be generated by $n$ elements one of which lies in $B$.
5
Define $\bar W =W/B$ and write $\bar w$ for the image of $w\in W$ under
the natural homomorphism $\pi : W\rightarrow \bar W$. As $M$ can be generated
by three elements $c\in C, b_{1},b_{2}\in B$ , we have 
$\bar W ={\it gp}(y_{1},...,y_{n-2}, c) $ and $\bar W$ is $n-1$-generator.

Define an epimorphism $\psi :F_{n}\rightarrow \bar W \  (F_{n}={\it 
gp}(x_{1},...,x_{n})$
by $\psi :x_{i}\mapsto y_{i} (i=1,...,n-2), x_{n-1}\mapsto \bar m_{1},
x_{n}\mapsto \bar m_{2}.$

Then $ker\psi$ does not contain a primitive element of $F_{n}$. Let $z$ be a
 preimage of $\bar c$ under $\psi$ There exist $z_{1}, z_{2} \in 
{\it gp}(x_{1}, ..., x_{n-2}, z) $ such that $z_{i}^{\psi }=\bar m_{i} (i=1,2)$
Then $r_{i}=x_{n-1}z_{1}^{-1}, r_{2}=x_{n}z_{2}^{-1}$, and the presentation
$H=<x_{1},...,x_{n}|r_{1}, r_{2} >$ has the needed property.

{\bf 5.Additional properties.} 

{\bf 6.Contrasts.} Every $n-1$-generated group that has a $1$-relator
presentation $G=<x_{1},...,x_{n}| r>$ is free and $r$ is a primitive element of 
$F_{n}={\it gp}(x_{1},...,x_{n})$ ( see [R.C.Lyndon, P.E.Shupp,
Combinatorial group theory. Springer-Verlag,
New-York. 1966]). For every $d\geq3$ there exists $d$-generated group $G$ that 
for any $n>d$ has a presentation $G=<x_{1},...,x_{n}|r_{1},...,r_{m}>$
such that the normal closure $R={\it gp _{F_{n}}}(r_{1},...,r_{m}) \unlhd F_{n}=
{\it gp}(x_{1},...,x_{n}) $ does not contain a primitive element of  \  $F_{n}$

{\bf 3.Description.} Let $Q$ denote the generalized quaternion 
group of order 32. It is known [ R.G.Swan, Projective modules
over group rings and maximal orders. Ann.Math.
76(1962), 55-61 ] that there exists a decomposition $M={\bf Z}G\oplus
{\bf Z}G = C\oplus B $ for $C\simeq {\bf Z}Q$ and some non-cyclic $Q$-module
$B$. Let $N\unlhd F_{n-1}$ such that $Q\simeq F_{n-1}/N$.Then

$G_{n}$ is an extension of ${\bf Z}Q$ by $F_{n-1}/N'$. 

{\bf 3.Explanation.} $G_{n}$ is polycyclic as $N/N'$ is free abelian
of rank $32(n-2)+1$ and $Q$ is finite solvable group. 
 
Clearly $G_{n}$ is $n$-generator. Let $\psi :M\rightarrow M/B\simeq C\simeq
{\bf Z}Q$. Let $m_{1},m_{2}$ be a standard base of $M$,$N=M\oplus T$,
where $T$ is the free $Q$-module of rank $n-1$ with a base $t_{1},...,t_{n-1}$.
Let $h_{i}=x_{i}N (i=1,...,n-1).$ Define $y_{i}=\pmatrix{h_{i}&0\cr
t_{i}&1\cr} (i=1,...,n-1), Y={\it gp}(y_{1},...,y_{n})\simeq ^{\rho}F_{n-1}/N'$
( see [ R.C.Lyndon,P.E.Shupp, Combinatorial group theory. Springer-Verlag,
New-York, 1966 ]). Let $R={\it gp}(\pmatrix{1&0\cr 
m&1\cr}|m\in M), E$ is an extension of $R$ by $Y$. Morphisms $\psi$ and
$\rho$ induce an epimorphism $\theta :E\rightarrow G$ given by $\theta :$
$\pmatrix{1&0\cr
m&1\cr}y\mapsto m^{\psi}y^{\rho}, ker\theta =\{ \pmatrix{1&0\cr
m&1\cr}|m\in ker\psi \}$. Then $E$ cannot be generated by $n+1$
elements one of which lies in $ker\theta$ , as non-cyclic $E$-module $B$
contains no unimodular elements.

{\bf 3.Description.} Let $G=<y,a,b|a^{y}=ab,b^{y}=b>=<x,y|[xyx^{-1},y]=1>$,
where $x=a^{-1}$. Then the element $g=[y,x^{2}yx^{-2}]$ is not finitely

$2$ 
and normal in $G$ with $G/F_{2}\simeq {\bf Z}.$ $G $ is the fundamental group
of a punctered-torus bundle over the circle, namely that

${\bf T} $ is the punctered
torus, by means of homeomorphism inducing the automorphism given by 
$a\mapsto ab, b\mapsto b$, of $F_{2}={\it gp}(a,b)=\pi _{1}({\bf T}).$

Write $A={\it gp _{G}}(y)={\it gp}(y_{i}=x^{i}yx^{-i}|i\in {\bf Z})=

Following to a well-known fact, that if $M=K\ast _{U}L, K_{1}\leq K, L_{1}\leq 
L, K_{1}\cap U=L_{1}\cap U=1$, then$S={\it gp}(K_{1},L_{1})=K_{1}\ast L_{1},
S\cap K=K_{1}, S\cap L=L_{1}$,write $H\cap {\it gp}(y_{0},y_{1},y_{2})={\it 
gp}(y_{0}y_{1}^{-2},y_{1}y_{2}^{-2}).$ Hence if $g\in H$, we should have $g\in 
{\it gp}(y_{0}y_{1}^{-2},y_{1}y_{2}^{-2})$, or,since $y_{1}$ centralizes this 
latter subgroup, $g\in {\it gp}(y_{0},y_{2}^{2})\simeq {\it gp}(y_{0})\ast {\it 
gp}(y_{2}^{2})$, which is impossible, and thus $g\not\in H$.

Let $L\unlhd G$ be of finite index in $G$, then $N=L\cap A\unlhd A, |A:N|<
\infty $. It can be verified that $(H\cap A)N\unlhd L$. From this and the
fact that $y_{i}y_{i+1}^{-2}\in H\cap A$ for every $i\in {\bf Z}$ it
will then follow that $A/(H\cap A)N$ is abelian (in fact cyclic), whence
$g\in (H\cap A)N$. It means that $g$ is not separated from $H$.

{\bf 3.Description.} Denote $F_{n}={\it gp}(x_{1},...,x_{n})$, the free group of 
rank $n$. Then $G_{n}=F_{n}/[F_{n}'',F_{n}]={\it 
gp}(z_{i}=x_{i}[F_{n}'',F_{n}](i=1,...,n))$.
Define the automorphism $\psi \in AutG_{n}$ satisfying $z_{1}^{\psi}=
z_{1}[[z_{1},z_{2}],[z_{3},z_{4}]$ and $z_{i}^{\psi}=z_{i} (i=2,...,n)$.
Then $\psi $ is non-tame.

{\bf 4.Explanation.} Since $[F_{n}'',F_{n}]\leq \gamma _{5}F_{n}$ we
have $N_{n4}\simeq F_{n}/\gamma _{5}F_{n}\simeq G_{n}/\gamma _{5}G_{n}$
the free nilpotent group of rank $n$ and class $4$ with base $y_{i}=
z_{i}\gamma _{5}G_{n} (i=1,...,n)$. By theorem from {\bf [BGLM]}
the automorphism $\varphi \in AutN_{n4}$ satisfying $y_{i}^{\varphi}=w_{i}y_{i} 
(i=1,...,n)$ for some elements $w_{i}\in \gamma _{4}$ is tame and $u_{i}\in
\gamma _{4}F_{n}$ be some words such that $w_{i}=u_{i}\gamma _{5}F_{n}
 (i=1,...,n)$ then for free Fox derivations $\delta _{i}=\delta /\delta x_{i}:
F_{n}\rightarrow {\bf Z}F_{n} (i=1,...,n)$ it should be

$\delta _{1}u_{1}+...\delta _{n}u_{n} \in (\Delta^{3}\cap [\Delta,\Delta])+
\Delta^{4}$,

where $\Delta$ is the augmentation ideal of$ {\bf Z}F_{n}$, and $[\Delta ,
\Delta ] $ is the additive subgroup of ${\bf Z}F_{n}$ spanned by allelements of 
the form $uv-vu, u,v\in \Delta$.

Let $u_{1}=[[x_{1},x_{2}],[x_{3},x_{4}]]$ and $u_{i}=1 (i\geq 2)$.
Then $\Sigma \delta _{i}u_{i}\equiv ((x_{4}-1)(x_{3}-1)-(x_{3}-1)(x_{4}-1))
(1-x_{2})mod\Delta _{4} \not\in (\Delta^{3}\cap [\Delta ,\Delta ])
mod\Delta _{4}$.

It follows that the automorphism $\psi$ induced non-tame automorphism
of $N_{n4}$ and so $\psi$ is non-tame.

{\bf 5.Additional properties.} It was shown in [ E.Stohr, On automorphisms
of centre-by-metabelian groups. Arch.Math. 48(1987), 376-380] that, for
$n\geq 4$ , the automorphism group $AutG_{n}$ is generated by tame 
automorphisms together with the automorphism $\psi$. It follows that
$AutG_{n}$ is finitely generated but the homomorphism $AutF_{n}\rightarrow
AutG_{n}$ is not onto.

{\bf 6.Contrasts.} The groups $AutG_{2}$ and $AutG_{3}$ are not finitely
generated (see the paper by E.Stohr citied above).

{\bf 3.Description.} Let $Q$ denote the generalized quaternion 
group of order 32. It is known [ R.G.Swan, Projective modules
over group rings and maximal orders. Ann.Math.
76(1962), 55-61 ] that there exists a decomposition $M={\bf Z}G\oplus
{\bf Z}G = C\oplus B $ for $C\simeq {\bf Z}Q$ and some non-cyclic $Q$-module
$B$. Let $N\unlhd F_{n-1}$ such that $Q\simeq F_{n-1}/N$.Then

$G_{n}$ is an extension of ${\bf Z}Q$ by $F_{n-1}/N'$. 

{\bf 3.Explanation.} $G_{n}$ is polycyclic as $N/N'$ is free abelian
of rank $32(n-2)+1$ and $Q$ is finite solvable group. 
 
Clearly $G_{n}$ is $n$-generator. Let $\psi :M\rightarrow M/B\simeq C\simeq
{\bf Z}Q$. Let $m_{1},m_{2}$ be a standard base of $M$,$N=M\oplus T$,
where $T$ is the free $Q$-module of rank $n-1$ with a base $t_{1},...,t_{n-1}$.
Let $h_{i}=x_{i}N (i=1,...,n-1).$ Define $y_{i}=\pmatrix{h_{i}&0\cr
t_{i}&1\cr} (i=1,...,n-1), Y={\it gp}(y_{1},...,y_{n})\simeq ^{\rho}F_{n-1}/N'$
( see [ R.C.Lyndon,P.E.Shupp, Combinatorial group theory. Springer-Verlag,
New-York, 1966 ]). Let $R={\it gp}(\pmatrix{1&0\cr 
m&1\cr}|m\in M), E$ is an extension of $R$ by $Y$. Morphisms $\psi$ and
$\rho$ induce an epimorphism $\theta :E\rightarrow G$ given by $\theta :$
$\pmatrix{1&0\cr
m&1\cr}y\mapsto m^{\psi}y^{\rho}, ker\theta =\{ \pmatrix{1&0\cr
m&1\cr}|m\in ker\psi \}$. Then $E$ cannot be generated by $n+1$
elements one of which lies in $ker\theta$ , as non-cyclic $E$-module $B$
contains no unimodular elements.

{\bf 2.Description.} Let $R={\bf Z}[1/2,x,x^{-1},(2-x)^{-1}]$ be a ring 
of rational functions  in one variable. Define

$G=<\pmatrix{1&0\cr
             1&1\cr},\pmatrix{2&0\cr 
                              0&1\cr},\pmatrix{x&0\cr 
                                               0&1\cr}, \pmatrix{2-x&0\cr 
                                                                 0&1\cr}>,
g=\pmatrix{x(2-x)&0\cr
           1&1\cr}, $
$ h=\pmatrix{x(2-x)&0\cr
                                x+1&1\cr}$. Then $g\not\sim _{G} h$, 
but $g\sim _{G/N} h $ for every $N\unlhd G, |G:N|<\infty $.

{\bf 4.Explanation.} $G $ is an extension of $ R^{+}$ by the group
$W={\it gp}(2,x,2-x)\leq R^{\ast}$,

$g^{G}=\{ \pmatrix {x(2-x)&0\cr
                    w+r(x-1)^{2}&1\cr}|w\in W, r\in R \}, R/R(x-1)^{2}=
{\bf Z}[1/2]\oplus {\bf Z}[1/2](x-1).$ 


If $h\in g^{G}$ then modulo $(x-1)^{2}R$ for some $w\in W \   w\equiv x+1$.
Now $x(2-x)\equiv 1$, so $w\equiv 2^{\alpha}x^{\beta}$ for some $\alpha ,
\beta \in {\bf Z}$.

Thus $2^{\alpha}(1+\beta (x-1)^{2})\equiv 2^{\alpha}x^{\beta}\equiv w
\equiv x+1\equiv 2+(x-1)$, which a comparison of the coefficients 
shows is impossible.

The unitriangular part $U$ of $G$ is $R^{+}$ and hence is $2$-divisible.
Thus $n=|U:N\cap U|$ is odd. For some $i,j \in {\bf Z}$
we have $1=2i-nj$, then 

$2x^{i}\equiv 2(1+i(x-1))\equiv 2+(1+nj)(x-1)\equiv x+1+nj(x-1)$,
then there exists $r\in R$ such that $2x^{i}+r(x-1)^{2}=
x+1+nj(x-1)$. Now for $k=\pmatrix {1&0\cr
                                   j(x-1)&1\cr} l=k^{n}\in N$.
Also $hl=\pmatrix{x(2-x)&0\cr
                  x+1+nj(x-1)&1\cr}\in g^{G}$,
thus $g\not\sim _{G/N} h$ , and $g$ is not conjugacy separable from $h$.

{\bf 5.Additional properties.} $G$ is torsion-free.

{\bf 6.Contrasts.}  Every finitely generated or minimax  soluble-by finite
subgroup of $GL_{2}(k)$ , where $k$ is a finite extension of ${\bf Q}$ is
conjugacy separable [B.A.Wehrfritz , Two examples of soluble groups that 
are not conjugacy separable. J.London Math.Soc. 7(1973), 312-316].

{\bf 3.Description and 4.Explanation.} 1) The case $n=2$, $G_{2}={\it gp}(x,y)$. 
Any 
automorphism of $G_{2}$ is a product of a tame automorphism and an 
automorphism from the subgroup $C=\cup _{p}C_{p}$, where $p$ is prime
or $1$, and $C_{p}$ is the subgroup of $AutG_{2}$ generated by the 
automorphisms 


$x\mapsto x[[x,y]^{x^{m}y^{n}},[x,y]], y\mapsto y,$

$x\mapsto x, y\mapsto y[[x,y]^{x^{m}y^{n}},[x,y]],$

where in case $p=1 \  m,n\in {\bf Z}$ such that $(|m|,|n|)=1$, and for
$p$ a prime $m$ and $n$ run over all integers divisible by $p$.

It was shown in {\bf [S]} that the automorphism 

$x\mapsto x[[x,y]^{x^{q}},[x,y]], y\mapsto y , q=1,2,3,5,...,$

is not a product of a tame automorphism and an automorphism from $C_{p}, 
p\not=q$.
 Thus  $AutG_{2}$ is not finitely generated.

2) The case $n=3$. The natural homomorphism $AutG_{3}\rightarrow AutM_{3}$,
$M_{3}$ free metabelian of rank $3$, is onto {\bf [BG]},non-finite
generality of $AutM_{3}$ [S.Bachmuth, H.Y.Mochizuki, The non-finite
generation of $Aut(G),G$ free metabelian of rank $3$ . Trans.Amer.Math.Soc.
270(1982), 693-700] implies such one for $AutG_{3}$.

{\bf 5.Additional properties.} Every of groups $AutG_{n}, n=2,3$ contains
non-tame automorphisms, as their subgroups of tame ones are finitely generated.

$Y_{1},Y_{1}^{-1},...,Y_{m},Y_{m}^{-1}], T$ free $\Lambda _{n}$-module

                                                           w_{i}&1\cr }|
i=1,...,m)$ free metabelian group of rank $n$. An element 
$\pmatrix {g&0\cr
           t&1\cr }\in M_{n}$ is primitive iff $t\in T$ is unimodular, i.e.
the coordinates of $t$ generate $\Lambda _{n}$ as ideal. Let $\Gamma _{m}=
{\bf Z}[X_{1}X_{1}^{-1},...,X_{m},X_{m}^{-1}] $
be the retract of $\Lambda _{n}$,$W$ free $\Gamma _
{m}$-module with a base  
$
w_{1},...,w_{m}, \bar {M_{n}}={\it gp}(x_{i},\bar {w_{i}}=\pmatrix {1&0\cr
                                                              w_{i}&1\cr }
| i=1,...,m>$. Then $W\simeq {\it gp}\bar {w} =\pmatrix {1&0\cr
                                                  w&1\cr }|w \in W)\unlhd
\bar {M_{n}}$.           

If a submodule $U$ of $W$ does not contain any unimodular element then the
inverce image $R$ of $\pmatrix {1&0\cr
                             U&1\cr }$
in $M_{n}$ does not contain a primitive element. Define for 
$b=\Sigma b_{i}w_{i}, \Sigma c_{i}w_{i} $ a scalar product
${\bf bc}=
\Sigma b_{i}c_{i}$. We set $w_{0}=\Sigma (X_{i}-2)w_{i}, f=\Sigma 
(X_{i}-2)^{2}-1
$ The equation $f=0$ defines in ${\bf R^{m}}$ the sphere ${\bf S^{m-1}}$ 
that has the centre $(2,...,2)$
and the radius $1$. Then  ${\bf S^{m-1}}$ does not intersect the coordinate 
planes, 
and we can consider $\Gamma _{m}$ as a ring of functions on it. 


Define $U=\{ w\in W| {\bf ww_{0}}\in \Gamma _{m}f\}$. We claim that $U$ does not 
contain
an unimodular element of $W$. Suppose that $b=(b_{1},...,b_{m})\in U$ is 
unimodular.
Then $b_{1},...,b_{m}$ don't vanish simultaneously on ${\bf S^{m-1}}$.
In other words $b$ defines a vector field on ${\bf S^{m-1}}$. We have $\Sigma 
b_{i}(X_{i}-2)=\gamma f
$ for some $\gamma \in \Gamma _{m}$, thus it is tangent vector field. It is 
known that every vector field on sphere of even degree has
at least one singular point  that gives contrudictory to unimodularity of $b$.

It follows that the preimage of $U$ in $M_{n}$ does not contain a primitive 
element.

Let $w\in W$ be an arbitary element. Then for $v=w-{\bf ww_{0}}w_{0}$ we have 
${\bf vw_{0}}=-{\bf ww_{0}}f, as {\bf w_{0}^{2}}=f+1$, i.e. $v\in U$ then 
$w={\bf ww_{0}}w_{0}+v$,
and  $M_{n}/R $ is $m+1$-generated. 
It completes verification of all claimed properties.

[V.A.Roman'kov, Primitive elements in free groups of rank $3$.

some

{\bf 4.Explanation.} 
 Define as $\psi$ the induced
by $\varphi$ epimorphism from $M_{3}$ onto $M_{2}$.
Every primitive element of $M_{3}$ containing in $S=ker\psi$     
is conjugated to $g$ or to $g^{-1}$ and so has no primitive preimage in
$F_{3}$ too.It follows that $R$ has no primitive elements.

$a_{ij}=2^{i+nj}, b_{ij}=c/a_{ij}, c$ a power of $2$ greater than
all the $a_{ij}$ \  ( the product for $w$ is written in any order).

{\bf 4.Explanation.} Let $\Lambda _{n}={\bf Z}/2{\bf Z}[[\xi _{1},...,
\xi _{n}]]$ be the algebra of formal non-commuting power series,
 $\Lambda ^{k} \  (k=0,1,...)$ homogeneous term of degree $k$,
$I _{k+1} \  (k=0,1,...)$ ideal consisting of all elements of degrees 
$\geq k+1$. We have the embedding $F_{n}=F_{n}(x_{1},...,x_{n})
\rightarrow \Lambda _{n}, x_{i}\mapsto 1+\xi _{i} \  (i=1,...,n)$ of the 
free group $F_{n}$ of rank $n$ into $\Lambda _{n}$, under which $mod I_{k+1}$

$w\mapsto 1+\Sigma _{1\leq i<j\leq n}(\xi_{i}^{a_{ij}}\xi _{j}^{a_{ij}}+
\xi _{j}^{a_{ij}}\xi _{i}^{a_{ij}})^{b_{ij}}\in 1+\Lambda ^{2c}$.

Suppose that there exists a homomorphism of $G_{n}$ onto free group
$F_{m}={\it gp}(y_{1},...,y_{m})$ embedded into $\Lambda _{m}=
{\bf Z}/2{\bf Z}[[\eta _{1},...,\eta _{m}]]$ in the same way.
Then there exists an epimorphism $\varphi :F_{n}\rightarrow F_{m}$
such that $w^{\varphi}=1$. Extend $\varphi$ to a homomorphism
of $\Lambda _{n}$ to $\Lambda _{m}$ in a next natural way: if 
$x_{i}^{\varphi}=(1+\xi _{i})^{\varphi}=g_{i}(y_{1},...,y_{m})=
g_{i}(1+\eta _{1},...,1+\eta _{m})=1+\nu _{i}$, then
$\xi _{i}^{\varphi}=\nu _{i} \  (i=1,...,n)$. This homomorphism is surjective
$mod\Lambda^{2}$ hence if $\nu _{i}=\beta _{i}+$terms of degree $\geq 2$,
where $\beta _{k}$ is homogeneous of degree $1$, we can write

$\beta _{k}=\Sigma _{q=1,...,p}c_{kq}\eta _{q},$

and the matrix $(c_{kq})$ has a rank $m$. It follows that 

$\Sigma _{1\leq i<j\leq n}(\beta _{i}^{a_{ij}}\beta _{j}^{a_{ij}}+
\beta _{j}^{a_{ij}}\beta _{i}^{a_{ij}})^{b_{ij}}=0$. Because the
$a_{ij}$ are distinct powers of $2$, the term $(\eta _{r}^{a_{ij}}
\eta _{s}^{a_{ij}})^{b_{ij}}$ occurs only in the $ij-$th summand.
This coefficient $c_{ir}c_{js}+c_{jr}c_{is}$ should be equal $0$. 
This means that in the matrix $(c_{kq})$, the determinant of every 
$2\times 2$-submatrix is zero. Thus, the matrix $(c_{kq})$ has rank
at most $1$, and so $m= 1$, as this case is clearly possible.
The corank of $G_{n}$ is therefore $1$.

AutAutG_{m}=A^{2}G_{m},...$ \ is the automorphism group sequence.

 H = < t, K_m : tyt^{-1} = x >, x_i = t^ixt^{-i}, i\in {\bf Z}.$ Let $L_m =

be the normal  closure  of $K_m$ in $H$. There is an embedding of $AutG_m$ into 
$AutL_m$.The $AutL_m$ can be 
computed . This is accomplished with using the structure  theorems for 
HNN-extensions.
Then the tower $Aut^iG_m$ is identified  with an ascending sequence $A_m^i $ of 
subgroups  of $AutL_m$.
It turns out that the sequence $Aut^iG_m$ is periodic iff some $A_m^i$ is 
complete.

{\bf 3. Description.} Let $\{ x, y \}$ be a basis of $F_2$.
Define $b_1 = x^{-2}y^{-3}, b_2 = x^{-2}(xy)^5.$

{\bf 4. Explanation. } The element $a = xy^2$ is equal to $b_1b_2 modF_2'$,
and $F_2$ is generated  by $b_1,b_2 modF_2'$. Denote $\widehat{(F_2)}_{(p)} $
the $p$-completeon of $F_2$. Then there exist s a pair of elements 
$g_1, g_2 \in \widehat{(F_2)}_{(p)}$ such that 
$a = b_1^{g_1}b_2^{g_2}$ in $\widehat{(F_2)}_{(p)}$. Thus 
$a$ must lie  in the $p$-adic  closure of $B$ in $F_2$. Notice that
$B\leq  gp_{F_2}(b_1, b_2),$ and the permutation representation 
$F_2\rightarrow {\bf S_4}, x\mapsto (12)(34), y\mapsto (135)$ sends $b_1$
and $b_2$ to $1$,but $a$ to $(12534)$. Thus $a\not\in B$, and $B$ is not

{\bf 3. Description. } The functions $\varphi : x\mapsto x+1$ and
$\psi : x^p (p$ is any
odd prime ) generate a free group $F_2$ under composition. 

{\bf 4. Explanation.}  Let $K = {\bf Q}(\omega _p, ..., \omega _{p^m},...)$ 
, where $\omega _{p^m}$ denotes $p^m$th root of unity in ${\bf C}$. 
Define a string $w = w _1,..., w _n$ made up of symbols
 $p (``p$th-power'' ), $r (``p$th-root'' ), and $t_k$
 ( ``translation by $0\not= k
\in {\bf Z}'')$. Define the degree by $d(w) = p^j$, where $j$ is the
number of $r$'s in $w$. Assume that no $p$ and $r$ are adjacent and no 
two symbols $t_k, t_l$ are adjacent. A chain $(\zeta _1, ..., \zeta _{n+1})$
is associated to $w$ if for each $i = 1,  ...,  n \  \zeta _{i+1} = \zeta _i+k$
if $w_i = t_k, \zeta _{i+1} = \zeta _i^p$, if $w_i = p$, and 
$\zeta _i = \zeta _{i+1}^p$, if $w_i = r$. 

Assume that $\zeta _1$ is transcendental over $K$. It is proved in {\bf [W]}
that $|K(\zeta _1, \zeta _{n+1} : K(\zeta _1)| = d(w)$. It follows that
$gp(\varphi , \psi )\simeq F_2$. 

{\bf 5. Additional properties. } In fact $K(\zeta _1, \zeta _{n+1})$
is a stratified algebraic extension of degree $d(w)$ over $K(\zeta _1)$, i.e.
for every  $0\leq m\leq d(w),$ there exists a unique extension of $K(\zeta _1)$ 
in $K(\zeta _1, \zeta _{n+1})$ of degree $p^m$.

 $\cal C$. Let $a\in A$ be a nontrivial
element written as a word in $x_1,..., x_n$, where $x_1,..., x_n$  is  a basis 
of $F(\cal C)$. Then the endomorphism of $F(\cal C)$ identical on

 with finite support, $V_i$ be the subgroup of $V$ consisting of
 all maps with support $[-i, i],

 k\in {\bf Z}.$
Let $G_i = V_i \lambda H_i, K_i =gp(z_i, H_i) = {\bf Z}_2 \times H_i =

Then $P = G_1 \ast _{H_1} G_2 \ast _{H_2} \ast ... , G = P\ast _{\cap H_i}

$T\simeq A\ast _K B,$ where $K$ is finite, $K\not= A,B.$ If $G$
is accessible then any process of successively  decomposing of $G$,
and the factors that arise in the process, as a proper product with
finite amalgamation terminates after a finite number of steps.

But we have for all $n$ the decomposition 

$G= (G_1\ast _{K_1}\ast ...\ast _{K_{n-1}} G_n)\ast _{K_n}J_n,$

A_1, B = gp(a^2, c)\leq B_1, H = gp(a^2)$. 

Thus $G$ is the free product 
of finitely generated torsion free nilpotent group $A$ of class 2 with a free 
abelian group $B$ of rank 2 amalgamating a maximal cyclic subgroup of $A$

$ [d_i, d_j] = 1, d_1^a = d_1d_2^2, d_2^a = d_2, d_3^a = d_3>,$

$ B = < a, c : [a, c] = 1 >, H = gp(a)$.    

Thus $G$ is  the free product of a finitely generated nilpotent 
group $A$ of class 2
with a free abelian group $B$ of rank 2 amalgamating a cyclic subgroup $gp(a)$.

{\bf 4. Explanation. } ( see {\bf [AD]}) 1) $G$ is a normal subgroup
of index 2 in $G_1 = A_1 \ast _{gp(a)} B_1$. Now every finite extension of a 
subgroup separable group is again subgroup separable. But $G_1$ is not subgroup
separable {\bf [GR]}.

$C =gp(ad_2^2, cd_1, d_2cd_1d_2^{-2}, d_3cd_3,
 d_2^{3}d_3cd_3d_2^{-1}\leq G$.

To see that $a\in K$ for any finite index subgroup $K$ of $G$ containing
$C$, note that $a^m\in K$ for some positive integer $m$ and apply

$(a) a^{2n}\in K \rightarrow a^n\in K.$

{\bf 3. Description.} 

$ G = < a, t : at^{-1}ata^2t^{-2}a^{-1}t^2 = 1 >. $


{\bf 4. Explanation.} Notice that the subgroup $H = gp(a, t^{-1}at)\leq G $
is a free group of rank 2. For every integer $n\geq 0$ put
$x_n = t^{-n}at^n.$ Then 

$gp(a^3, t)\cap H = gp(x_0, x_1, ...)$

and this intersection is a free group with basis $x_1, x_2,...$.     

{\bf 5. Additional properties.} The subgroup $H$ is not quasiconvex in $G$.


 The group $G$ is not finite separable
with respect to a finitely generated subgroups. For example the element
$g = tat^{-1}$ does not belong to $H$, but  it belongs to every subgroup
$NH$ where $N$ is a normal subgroup of finite index in $G$. 


{\bf 6. Contrasts.} If $G$ is a finitely generated one-relator group
 with torsion of order at least 5 then $G$ is word hyperbolic and all
two-generator subgroups of $G$ are quasiconvex in $G$. In particular 
this implies that the intersection of any two two-generator subgroups
of $G$ is quasiconvex and finitely generated ( Kapovich, I. Quasiconvex 
subgroups of one-relator groups with torsion. PhD Thesis, CUNY, 1996).

$n\in {\bf N}$,

finite quotients.

$$G=<t, s, y_1,...,, y_m : [t,s] = 1, y_i^s = y_iy_i^t, [y_i, y_j] =

\noindent is metabelian and can be mapped homomorphically onto the group 
$H_n = M_n\lambda C \simeq B  = R \times C$,
 where $C = gp(x, x+1)\leq S = {\bf Z}[x, x^{-1}, (x+1)^{-1},
$ a subring of $R$. This homomorphism is defined by the map 
$t\mapsto x, s\mapsto x+1, y_i\mapsto x_i $.Since metabelian groups satisfy
the maximal condition on normal subgroups, $B$ must be finitely presented.
Since each $G_n$ is a finite extension of the finitely presented group
$B$, each of the groups $G_n$ is finitely presented.

{\bf 2. References. [R]} Rips E. On a double of a free group, Israel
J. Math. 96(1996), 523-525.

{\bf 3. Description. } The group $G$ is defined by 

$G = < x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 : x_1^3 = x_2^3, y_1^3 = y_2^3, 
x_1y_1^{-1} = x_2y_2^{-1}, x_1^2y_1^{-1}x_1^{-1} = x_2^2y_2^{-1}x_2^{-1} >$.

Then $F_1 = gp(x_i, y_i), i =1, 2, N = gp(x_1^3, y_1^3, x_1y_1^{-1},
x_1^2y_1^{-1}x_1^{-1} ), F_1/N \simeq F_2/N \simeq C_3.$

Let $A = < a, b : r_1(a, b) = .... = r_m(a, b) = 1 > $  be a finitely presented 
group with an unsolvable word 
problem.  Take $ s_i = r_i(x_1^{-1}, x_1^2y_1^{-1}x_1^{-1}), 1\leq i\leq m.$

Then define 

$H = gp(x_1y_2^{-1}, x_1^2y_2^{-1}x_1^{-1}, x_1^3, y_2^3, s_1, ..., s_m ).$

{\bf 4. Explanation.} $H/H\cap N$ is a free group of rank 2 generated by the 
images of 
$x_1y_2^{-1}$ and  $x_1^2y_2^{-1}x_1^{-1}, H\cap N =gp(x_1^3, y_2^3, s_1, ... , 
s_m ), N/H\cap N \simeq A$.

Thus for any word $w$  on the letters $a, b$, the equality  $w(a, b) = 1$ holds 
in $A$ if and only if 
$w(x_1y_1^{-1}, x_1^2y_1^{-1}x_1^{-1}) \in H\cap N.$

{\bf 5. Additional properties. } $G$ is a {\it double}, i.e. there is an 
isomorphism  
$\alpha : F_1 \rightarrow  F_2 $ which is identity on $N$.

$G$ is not subgroup separable, since in every finitely presented subgroup 
separable group 
the occurence problem is solvable.

{\bf 6. Contrasts.} The free product of groups with a solvable occurence problem 
also has a solvable
occurence problem ( Mikhailova K.A. On occurence problem in free products of 
groups. Mat. Sbornik 75(1968),

$gp(u, u^{\ast })\leq U_1({\bf Z}G)\leq U({\bf Z}G)$is a nonabelian free

{\bf 3. Description.} Take any $x, y\in G, |x| = n< \infty .$ For
$v = (1-x)y(1+x+...+x^{n-1}),$ we have $v^2 = 0.$ Then $u = 1+v \in U_1({\bf 
Z}G)$
is called bycyclic. As usual $\ast $ denotes the anti-involution on 
${\bf Z}G$ given by $(\sum a_gg)^{\ast }= \sum a_gg^{-1}$.

{\bf 4. Explanation. } The pair $(v, v^{\ast })$ is {\it independent}, i.e. 
we have a monoid embedding $v\mapsto a, v^{\ast }\mapsto b$ to the monoid 
defined by the presentation  $\Sigma = < a, b : a^2 = b^2 = 0 >$. Thus
$vv^{\ast }$ is not nilpotent. If $S$, the monoid generated by a pair 
$(v, v^{\ast })$ in ${\bf Z}G$, is such that $S\setminus \{ 0\} \subseteq {\bf 
C}G$
is linearly independent, then  the pair $(u, u^{\ast })$ generates a non-abelian
free subgroup in $U_1({\bf Z}G)$. To prove it consider the representation 
$\rho : \Sigma \rightarrow M_2({\bf Z})$ given by $\rho (v) = e_{12}(2),
\rho (v^{\ast }) = e_{21}(2).$ It extends  by linearity to a ring 
homomorphism  $\rho _1 ; R \rightarrow M_2({\bf Z})$, where 
$R$ is the ${\bf Z}$-linear  span of the monoid generated  by $v, v^{\ast }$
in ${\bf Z}G$, then $\rho _1(u) = t_{12}(2), \rho _1(v^{\ast } = t_{21}(2)$
and  hence  $u, u^{\ast }$ generate together a nonabelian free subgroup by 
Sanov's theorem. In the case $S\setminus \{ 0 \} $ is not linearly independent 
some
extra  arguments should be presented ( see {\bf [MS]}.)

{\bf  3. Description.} 

$G = < a, b, s, t : [a, b]=1, a^s = (ab)^2 , b^t = (ab)^2 >.$

{\bf 4. Explanation.} $G$ is formed from a free abelian
group $A_2 = gp(a, b)$ by two HNN-extensions associating cyclic subgroups of 
$A_2$. Choose
a regular language of coset representatives for each of these subgroups, namely
the languages $\{ b^n \}, \{ a^n \}, \{ a^n,  (ab)a^n \}$ respectively. 
Furthermore,
 we choose the regular language $\{ a^nb^m\}$ as a set of  representatives
for the elements of $A_2.$ Then The Normal Form Theorem ( see Lyndon R.C. and 
Schupp P.E.
Combinatorial Group Theory, Springer-Verlag, New York - Berlin, 1977 ) provide 
us 
with the regular language of representatives  for the elements of $G$. This 
language satisfies the 
``fellow-traveller'' property and hence $G$ is automatic.

$G$ is not Hopfian since the endomorphism $\psi : a \mapsto a^2, b\mapsto b^2, 
s\mapsto s,
t\mapsto t$ is surjective, but not injective, because for instance 

$\psi ([(ab)^{s^{-1}}, (ab)^{t^{-1}}] = [a, b ] = 1.$

{\bf 3. Description.} Let $\Pi = L\cup M\cup N \ ( 2\in N )$ be a presentation 
of the set 
$\Pi $ of all prime numbers as a  union of pairwise disjoint infinite subsets. 
The group $G$ 
is generated by the following $3\times 3$-matrices over ${\bf Q}$.

$a_p = t_{12}(1/p)t_{13}(1/p^2), p\in L; b_p = t_{13}(1/p^2)t_{23}(1/p), p\in 
M;$

$c_p = t_{12}(1/p)t_{23}(1/p), p\in N.$

{\bf 4. Explanation.} Obviously $G$ is torsion-free nilpotent of class 2 group.

The center $C(G)$ of $G$ consists of all matrices $t_{13}(\rho ), \rho \in {\bf 
Q}+ 1/l{\bf Q},
l$ is sguare-free integer. Every automorphism of $G$ is trivial on $C(G)$ and  
$G/C(G)$.

Let $\varphi \in AutG$.  Then we can define a homomorphism $\psi : 
G/C(G)\rightarrow C(G)$
induced by the map $g\mapsto \varphi (g)g^{-1}$. Let 
$\psi (\bar{t}_{12}) = t_{13}(\sigma ), \psi (\bar{t}_{23}) = t_{13}( \rho ).$
Then for $h = t_{12}(\rho )t_{23}(-\sigma )t_{13}(\tau )$ we have $hgh^{-1} = 
\varphi (g), \forall g\in G$.
It remains to show that $h\in G$ for suitable $\tau $.

A group $G$ is called {\it efficient} if it admits a presentation

with  $m-n = d(H_2(G)) - \beta (H_1(G))$, where $d$ denotes the minimal

{\bf 3. Description.}  $G = Q + C $, where $Q$ denotes the trefoil group
$Q = < x_1, x_2 : x_1^2 = x_2^3 >$. 

{\bf 4. Explanation.} $Q$ is the fundamental group of an aspherical 
2-complex $L$, $d(H_1(L)) = \chi (L) + 1, d(Q) \geq d(H_1(L)) + 1,$
and  ${\bf Z}Q\not= I_1(Q)$ ( the first Fox ideal of $Q$ ( see

and Combinatorial Group Theory, ed.  Latiolais P., Lect. Notes
in Math. 1440, Springer-Verlag, 1991, 164-174 ). Hence the complex
$K = L \times S^1$ is a $K(G, 1)$-space,
$d(H_2(G)) = d(H_2(K)) = d(H_2(L)\oplus (H_1(L)\otimes  H_1(S^1))) = 
d({\bf Z} = 1, \beta (H_1(G)) - 2.$

x_1^2 x_2^{-3}  = x_1x_3x_2^{-1}x_3^{-1}  =  x_2x_3x_2^{-1}x_3^{-1} =  1$
 has as one-vertex 2-complex the 2-sceleton $K^2$ of $K$. From the asphericity 
of $K$ follows that $\pi _2K^2$ is generated as ${\bf Z}G$-module by the 
boundary $\partial e^3 $ of the 3-cell $e^3$ in the universal covering of $K$,
where  $e^3$ is any lift of the only 3-cell of $K$. 

Using Fox calculus we have $\partial e^3 = (x_3 - 1)d( x_1^2x_2^{-3} +
(1+ x_1)dx_1x_3x_2^{-1}x_3^{-1} + - (1 + x_2 +x_2^2)d(x_2x_3x_2^{-1}x_3^{-1}$,
where  $dX$ denotes a suitable lift to the universal covering of the 2-cell
in $K$ which corresponds to the relator $X$. 

A representation $\rho : {\bf Z}G \rightarrow {\bf Z}/3{\bf Z}$ with $
-\rho (x_1) = \rho (x_2) = \rho (x_3 ) = 1 $ allows to use Deficiency

< a, b : a^{\alpha }b^{\beta }a^{\gamma }b^{\delta } =1, (\alpha +\gamma )(\beta

is residually finite iff one of the following conclusions hold:

$(2) \alpha +\gamma = 0$ and either $1\in \{ |\beta |, |\delta |\}$ or $|\beta |

$(3) \beta + \delta = 0$ and either $1\in \{ |\alpha |, |\gamma |\}$ or $|\alpha

In ( Kim G. and McCarron J., On amalgamated products of residually p-finite 
groups. 
J.Algebra 162(1993),  1-11 ) it was proved that an amalgamated product $G = 
A\ast _HB$, where 
$A$ and $B$ are residually p-finite and $H$ is cyclic, is residually p-finite in 
the case 
$H$ is closed in the pro-p topologies in $A$ and in $B$. Then the group $G = < 
a, b : [a^{\alpha }, b^{\beta }] = 1 >$
is residually p-finite iff $\alpha $ and $\beta $ are powers of $p$. And so $1)$ 
follows.

Suppose that $B$ is residually p-finite group and that $H$ is a nontrivial, 
abelian subgroup of $B$. Then 
HNN-extension $G = < B, t : t^{-1}ht = h^{-1}, h\in H > $ is residually p-finite 
 only if $p = 2$ and $H$ is
closed in pro-2 topology in $B$. Then $2)$ can be deduced. To prove $3)$ we need 
in the
 following assertion: $H = < x, b : x^{-1}bx = b ^{\delta } >$ is residually 
p-finite iff $\delta \equiv  1(mod(p))$.

$G = < a_1, ..., a_m : a_1^{\alpha _1} = a_2^{\beta _1}, ..., a_{m-1}^{\alpha 
_{m-1}} =
a_m^{\beta _{m-1}} >,$

\noindent where $\alpha _i, \beta _i\geq 2 \ ( i =1,...,m )$ and$ (\alpha 
_i,\beta _j) = 1$ for $j < i$.

Let $A_i = < a_i : \emptyset > $ then $G$ is a tree product of $A_i ( i =1, ..., 
m )$.
Therefore  $G_1 = gp(a_1, a_2)$ and  $G_2 = gp(a_2 , a_3)$ have the one-relator 
presentations 

$G_1 = < a_1, a_2 : a_1^{\alpha _1} = a_2^{\beta _1} >$ and 

$G_2 = < a_2 , a_3 : a_2^{\alpha _2} = a_3^{\beta _2} >$.

Since $G$ is residually nilpotent, hence, so are $G_1$ and $G_2$. Then there are 
prime numbers 
$p_1$ and $p_2$ such that $\alpha _1$ and $\beta _1$ are powers of $p_1$, and 
such that 
$\alpha _2 $ and $\beta _2$ are powers of $p_2$. It follows that $p_1 \not= 
p_2$. We deduce that 
$m\leq 2.$ Then $G = < a_1 , a_2 : a_1 ^{\alpha _1} = a_2 ^{\beta _1} >$, where
$\alpha _1$ and $\beta _1$ are powers of the same prime number $p_1$.

Now suppose that $G_{ab} \simeq A_2$. Then 

$G = < t, a_1,..., a_m : t^{-1}a_1t = a_m, a_1^{\alpha _1} = a_2^{\beta _1}, 
..., a_{m-1}^{\alpha _{m-1}}$ =
$a_m^{\beta _{m-1}} >$ with restrictions on $\alpha _i, \beta _i$ as before, and 
the additional 
constraint that $\alpha _1 ... \alpha _{m-1} = \beta _1 ... \beta _{m-1}.$

The presentation exhibits $G$ as an HNN-extension with a base group as a tree 
product of cyclic groups.
Consequently from the first part of the explanation, we must have $m = 2$, and 
$G = < a, b, c : 
a^{-1}ba = c, b^{\beta } = c^{\beta } >\simeq < a, b : [a, b^{\beta }] = 1 >.$

{\bf 3. Description.} It is known ( see ( Magnus W., Karrass A.,
Solitar D., Combinatorial group theory, Wiley, New York, 1966) that

$Aut(F_2) = < P, S, U : P^2 = S^2 = (SP)^4 = (UPSP)^2 = (UPS)^3 =
[U, SUS ] = 1 >$, where $F_2 = < a, b : \emptyset >, P : (a, b) \mapsto 
(b, a), S : (a,b) \mapsto (a^{-1},b), U : (a,b)\mapsto (ab,b).$    

{\bf 4. Explanation.}  1) Thurston's automatic structure on the braid group 
$B_4$ ( see {\bf [E]} ) gives an automatic  structure  on $B_4/C(B_4)$. 
The group $B_4/C(B_4)$ is isomorphic to the  special automorphism 
group $Aut_{+}(F_2)$ of $F_2$ which  has index 2 in $Aut(F_2)$ {\bf [DFG]}.
Thus  $Aut(F_2)$ has an automatic structure.

2) {\bf [B]} Define the automorphisms of $F_2$ 

$\alpha : (a,b)\mapsto (b^{-1},ab^3), \beta : (a,b)\mapsto (b^{-1}ab^2,ab^2), 
\sigma _g : (a,b)\mapsto (g^{-1}ag, g^{-1}bg)$

$ (g\in F_2)$. Then 

$H = gp(\alpha , \beta , \sigma _a , \sigma _b) =
<\alpha , \beta , \sigma _a , \sigma _b :$

$\alpha ^{-1}\sigma _a \alpha = \sigma _b^{-1}, \alpha ^{-1}\sigma _b\alpha =
\sigma _a\sigma _b^3, \beta ^{-1}\sigma _a\beta = 
\sigma _b^{-1}\sigma _a\sigma _b^2, \beta ^{-1}\sigma _b\beta = \sigma _a\sigma 
_b^2 >.$

The group $H$ is the fundamental group  of the 2-complex $L$. $L$ has 3
0-cells : 0, 1 and 2; 18 1-cells given by 
$x_1, y_1, z_1, w_1  : 1\rightarrow 0; x_2, y_2, z_2, w_2 : 2\rightarrow 1;
x_0, y_0, z_0, w_0 : 0\rightarrow 2; t_1, s_1 : 1\rightarrow 2;
t_2, s_2 : 2\rightarrow 0; t_0, s_0 : 0\rightarrow 1;$ and 16 2-cells, whose
boundaries are all of length  3: 
$x_0y_2z_1, x_0z_2t_0^{-1}, z_0x_2t_0^{-1}, y_0w_2s_0^{-1},$

$ w_0y_2s_0^{-1},
y_0z_2w_1, x_1w_0t_1^{-1}, z_1y_0t_1^{-1}, y_1x_0s_1^{-1},$

$ w_1z_0s_1^{-1},
z_0w_2x_1, x_2z_1t_2^{-1}, z_2x_1t_2^{-1}, y_2w_1s_2^{-1},$
 
$w_2y_1s_2^{-1}, w_0x_2y_1.$

This a piecewise Euclidean 2-complex has nonpositive curvature, i.e. every 
nontrivial  circuit  in the link  of every  vertex has total angular measure at 
least $2\pi$.

By  ( Gersten S.M. and Short H., Small cancellation theory and 
automatic groups. Invent. Math. 102(1990), 305-334 ) the fundamental 
group of $L$ has an automatic structure.

{\bf 1. Property.} A canonical presentation for  one-relator group  $G$ with  a 
non-trivial centre.

{\bf 3. Description.} Let $G$ be a non-cyclic one-relator group with non-trivial 
centre.
Then  it is uniquelly presentable  in one of two ways; either as a tree product 
of cyclic groups
( in the case $G_{ab}$ is not $A_2$, free abelian of rank 2 )

$G = < a_1, ..., a_m : a_1^{\alpha _1} =  a_2^{\beta _1}, ..., a_{m-1}^{\alpha 
_{m-1}}=a_m^{\beta _{m-1}}>$

where 

$\alpha _i, \beta _i \geq 2  ( i = 1,...,m )$ and  $(\alpha _i, \beta _j ) = 1 $ 
for $ j <  i $,

or as an HNN-extension with tree product of cyclic groups as a base 
( in the case $G_{ab}\simeq A_2$ )

$G = < t, a_1, ..., a_m : t^{-1}a_1t = a_m, a_1^{\alpha _1} = a_2^{\beta _1}, 
... , a_{m-1}^{\alpha _{m-1}} =
a_m^{\beta _{m-1}} >$,

with restrictions on $\alpha _i, \beta _i $ as before, and the additional 
constraint that $\alpha _1 ... \alpha _{m-1} =
\beta _1 ... \beta _{m-1}.$

{\bf 4. Explanation.} We may assume first that $G = < a, b : r(a, b)=1 >$ where 
the exponent sum  of $a$
in $r(a, b)$  is zero and the exponent sum of $b$ is a positive integer $d$. Let 
$N = gp_G(b)$. By Murasugi's 
result  $N$ is a finitely generated  free group. Then $N\cap C(G) = 1, N\geq G', 
G/N\simeq {\bf Z},
N/G'\simeq {\bf Z}_d.$ Hence $G/G'C(G)$ is finite. Thus by  ( Karrass A., 
Pietrowski A., Solitar D. 
Finite and infinite cyclic extensions of free groups, J. Austral. Math. Soc. 
16(1973), 458-466 ) 
$G$ is a tree product of finitely many infinite cyclic groups. By factoring out 
from $G$
the normal closure of the non-extremal vertices of the tree product we then 
obtain a free product whose factors 
are the extremal vertices modulo their amalgamated subgroups; therefore each 
factor of a free product is a
non-trivial cyclic group. Hence the rank of this factor group of $G$ is the 
number of extremal vertices of $G$.
Thus $G$ has at most two extremal vertices. So $G$ has a presentation as given 
above. 

Since $G_{ab}\simeq A_2$  we can use ( Meskin S., Pietrowski A., Steinberg  A. 
One-relator groups with center.
J.Austral. Math. Soc. 16(1973), 319-323 ) to conclude as before that $G$ has the 
claimed
presentation.



{\bf Inaccesible group.}

{\bf 0. Group.} Finitely generated inaccessible $(G)$.

{\bf Key words : } {\it accessible group, fundamental group of a graph of 
groups, end of a group, finitely generated group, Cayley graph.}

{\bf 1. Property.} The group $G$ is inaccessible, 
 i.e. $G$ can not be presented as the fundamental group of a graph of groups
 in which all edge groups are finite and every vertex group has at most one end.

{\bf 3. Description.} Let $H = gp(t_0 = (0,1), s:i \mapsto i+1 (i\in {\bf Z)}
\leq Symm {\bf Z}, H_i = gp( t_{-i} = (-i, -i+1 ),  t_{-i+1}= (-i+1, -i+2),...,
t_{i-1}=(i-1,i))\simeq {\bf S}_{2i+1}, i\in {\bf Z}.$ Let $V$ be
 the additive group of all maps ${\bf Z} \rightarrow {\bf Z}/2{\bf Z}$
 with finite support, $V_i$ be the subgroup of $V$ consisting of
 all maps with support $[-i, i],
i=0,1,2,...$  Then $H$ acts on $V$ by $v^h(k)=v(h(k)), v\in V, h\in H,
 k\in {\bf Z}.$
Let $G_i = V_i \lambda H_i, K_i =gp(z_i, H_i) = {\bf Z}_2 \times H_i =
G_i \cap G_{i+1} $, where $ z_i(k) = 1$ for $ k \in [-i,i]$.

Then $P = G_1 \ast _{H_1} G_2 \ast _{H_2} \ast ... , G = P\ast _{\cap H_i}
H = gp(G_1, H).$

{\bf 4. Explanation.} It is proved  in ( Stallings, J.R. Group Theory
And Three-Dimensional Manifolds, Yale Math. Monographs 4, Yale Univ.
 Press, 1971 ) that a group $T$ has more than one end iff 
$T\simeq A\ast _K B,$ where $K$ is finite, $K\not= A,B.$ If $G$
is accessible then any process of successively  decomposing of $G$,
and the factors that arise in the process, as a proper product with
finite amalgamation terminates after a finite number of steps.

But we have for all $n$ the decomposition 

$G= (G_1\ast _{K_1}\ast ...\ast _{K_{n-1}} G_n)\ast _{K_n}J_n,$

where $J_n= (G_{n+1}\ast _{K_{n+1}}\ast ...\ast ...)\ast_{\cup H_i}H$.
It follows immediately that $G$ is inaccessible.

{\bf 5. Additional properties.}

{\bf 3. Description.} Let $A$ be any
 uncountable indecomposable abelian group existing by
 ( Fuchs, L. The existence of indecomposable abelian groups
 of arbitrary power, Acta Math. Hung. 10(1959), 453-457).

{\bf 4. Explanation. } Let $A= V(F(\cal C))$, a verbal subgroup of a
 relatively free group $F(\cal C)$ in some variety
 $\cal C$. Let $a\in A$ be a nontrivial
element written as a word in $x_1,..., x_n$, where $x_1,..., x_n$  is  a basis 
of $F(\cal C)$. Then the endomorphism of $F(\cal C)$ identical on 
$x_1,..., x_n$ and trivial on the rest of basis extracts from $A$
 a proper subgroup being a retract. Therefore $A$ 
decomposes into the direct sum of proper subgroups,
, contrary to the choise of $A$.

{\bf 3. Description. } Let $A= {\bf Q_{(2)}}=\{ a^{n/2^{k}}| n,k\in {\bf Z}\}$
be the group of dyadic fractions written multiplicatively.
Define $G=A\lambda {\bf Z}$, where ${\bf Z}= gp(b)$ by
$b^{-1}ab=a^{4}$. Add $b^{1/2}$ to $G$ by two different ways:
$G_{1}=<G,b^{1/2}| b^{-1/2}ab^{1/2}=a^{2}>,$ and $G_{2}=<A_1 \times$
$A_2, b^{1/2} (A\simeq A_i =\{ a_i^{n/2^{k}}| n,k \in {\bf Z} (i=1,2)|$
$b^{-1/2}a_1 b^{1/2}=a_2^2, b^{-1/2}a_2 b^{1/2}=a_1^2>.$ The
metabelian  $R-$groups $G_1,G_2$ are embedded into  metabelian
$D-$completions given as products of completions of abelian 
factors of $G_1,G_2.$

{\bf 4. Explanation.} The $D-$completions of $A,A_1\times A_2$ are maximal
abelian normal subgroups in $\bar {G_1}, \bar {G_2}$ consequently,
$G\simeq  gp(A,b) \simeq gp(A_1\times A_2,b).$
Every element $g\in A$ is conjugated to $g^2$ in $\bar {G_1}$,
the element $a_1 \in A_1 $ is not conjugated to $a_1^2$ in $\bar {G_2}.$
Hence $\bar {G_1}\not \simeq \bar {G_2}.$

{\bf 5. Additional properties.}

{\bf 6. Contrasts.} Obviously every abelian $R-$group has only one abelian
$D-$completion. The similar assertion is valid for every torsion-free
nilpotent group that is in fact $R-$group, and can be embedded into
$D-$completion, and such $D-$completion is unique ( Mal'cev A.I.,
Nilpotent torsion-free groups. Izv. Academy of
Sciences USSR. Ser. mat. 13(1949), 201-212 (in Russian)).

$c^{-1}ac=a^{2}$.
Then $G=H\lambda {\bf Z}$, where ${\bf Z}=gp(b)$ and
the extension is defined by formulas: $b^{-1}ab=a^2, b^{-1}cb=c^{-1}a.$

{\bf 4. Explanation.} $R-$property means that every equation
$x^m=g, g\in G,$ has at most one solution, $D-$property
means that every such equation has exactly one solution.

Suppose that $\bar {G}$ is a $D-$group contained $G$. Then
there exists an element $d\in \bar {G}$ such that $d^{3}=a$.
It implies that $b^{-1}db=d^{2},$ hence $(db^{-1})^{2}=$
$db^{-1}dbb^{-2}=d^{3}b^{-2}=ab^{-2},$ but 
$(cb^{-1})^{2}=cb^{-1}cbb^{-2}=c(c^{-1}a)b^{-1}=ab^{-2}$ too.
Thus $c=d$ that contradicts to $c^{3}\not= a.$ We have proved that

$< a_4, b_4 | b_4^{a_4}=b_4^2 >$

under amalgamation $a_1=b_4, a_4=b_3.$ It follows that $G$ is nontrivial
and torsion free. Let $N$ be a maximal normal subgroup in $G$ then
$H=G/N.$

{\bf 4. Explanation.} Let $K = gp(b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4)$ be a finite group 
in which the
elements $b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4 $ satisfy to the defining relations of $G$.
Let $l_1, l_2, l_3, l_4 $ be the orders of $b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4$ in $K$.
Then $l_2 | 2^{l_1}-1, l_3 | 2^{l_2}-1, l_4 | 2^{l_3}-1, l_1 | 2^{l_4}-1.$
Since for $n\geq 2$ the smallest prime divisor of $2^n-1$ exceeds
the smallest prime divisor of $n$ it follows that $l_1=l_2=l_3=l_4=1,$
and so $K$ is trivial. Thus every proper normal subgroup of $G$
has an infinite index in $G$. Then for a maximal normal subgroup
$N \leq G$ a quotient group $G/N$ is an infinite simple group.

     {\bf 0. Group.} Finitely generated  (nilpotent of class two)-by-
abelian $( G ).$

     {\bf Key words:} nilpotent group, verbal subgroup, width, solvable group.

     {\bf 1. Property.} The second derived subgroup $\delta_2G$ has an
infinite width as a $[[x_1,x_2],[x_3,x_4]]-$verbal subgroup.

     {\bf 3.Description.} Let $A_2=gp(a,b)$ be a free abelian group of rank
$2$. Define

     $$
     G = gp(diag(a,1,b), t_{21}, t_{32}) \leq
      T_3( {\bf Z}A_2).$$


     {\bf 4. Explanation.} An element $\alpha \in {\bf Z}A_2$ is said to
be split if $\alpha = \beta (a)\gamma (b) $ a product of elements depending
from $a$ and $b$ consequently. It is easy to prove the element
$\alpha _n=ab+a^2b^2+...+a^nb^n$ cann't be presented as a sum of $m\leq n-1$
split elements.

Clearly $G'=\{ (\lambda_{ij})\in UT_3({\bf Z}A_2 ) | \lambda_{21}$
$=\lambda_{21}(a), \lambda_{32}=\lambda _{32}(b), \lambda _{31}=\lambda _{31}$
(a$,b)\} .$ For $A,B \in G'$ we have $[A,B]=t_{31}(\alpha )$ where $\alpha $
can be presented as a sum of $k\leq 2$ split elements. Thus $t_{31}$
$(\alpha _{2n+2}) \in \delta _2G$ cann't be written as a product of values
of the word $[[x_1,x_2],[x_3,x_4]].$


     {\bf 5. Additional properties.}

     {\bf 6. Contrasts.} Every verbal subgroup  $v(H)$, $v$ is
     a word, where $H$ is a finitely generated abelian-by-nilpotent
     group ( P.Stroud, Thesis, Cambridge, 1966 ), or $H$ is a
     polycyclic group  (J.Wilson, On outer-commutator words,
Canad.J.Math. 26(1974), in case of the title, [R] in general case )
has a finite width. Every finitely generated group $K\in {\cal {AC}}$
where ${\cal A}$ is the variety of abelian groups, ${\cal C}$ is a variety in 
which
every finite generated group has a
property $max_n$, has the derived subgroup of a
finite width. In particular every ${\cal {AAP}}$-group,
${\cal P}$ is the class of polycyclic
groups, has the derived subgroup of finite width ( A.H.Rhemtulla,
Commutators of certain finitely generated
soluble groups, Canad. J.Math. 21(1969),
1160-1164 ).

{\bf 3. Description.} Let $A\simeq {\bf Z}^9\simeq M_3({\bf Z})$

$gp(x,y)$ as $a^g=g^tag,$ where $t$ means a transposition.
 Define $G_1=A\lambda gp(x)$, $G_2=A\lambda gp(y)$,
$G=G_1\ast _AG_2\simeq A\lambda SL_3({\bf Z}).$

{\bf 4. Explanation.} There exists an element $a_0\in A$ such that
the orbit $a_0 ^{SL_3({\bf Z})}$ is not closed in the profinite topology
of $G$ [ see Grunewald, F., Segal, D. Conjugacy in polycyclic groups.
Comm.Algebra 6(1978), 775-798 ]. Hence there exists an element
$a_0 \in cl(a_0 ^{SL_3({\bf Z})})$ not in $a_0 ^{SL_3({\bf Z})}$,
 i.e. $a_0\not\sim b$ in $G$ but
$a_0 \sim b modN $ for every normal subgroup $N$ of finite index in $G$,
and the group $G$ is not conjugacy separable.

Let $H=H_1\ast _B H_2$ be an amalgamated free product of conjugacy

$2$ normal subgroup $B$. Then $H$ is conjugacy separable group [ZT].

{\bf 3. Description.} Let $N$ be a free nilpotent group of class
$2$ and rank $3$ with a basis $a_1,a_2,a_3$, Then $N'$ is a free
abelian group of rank $3$ with a basis $b_1=[a_2,a_3],$
$b_2=[a_3,a_1], b_3=[a_1,a_2]$. An automorphism $\alpha $ of
$N$ is defined by the formulas: $a_1^{\alpha}=a_2,$
$a_2^{\alpha}=a_3, a_3^{\alpha}=a_1a_2^{-1}$. Define $G$ to be
the semidirect product $G=N\lambda gp(\alpha).$

{\bf  4. Explanation.} The effects of $\alpha$ on $N_{ab}=N/N'$
and on $N'$ are respectively described by the matrices

$B=\pmatrix {0&1&0\cr
	      0&0&1\cr
	      1&-1&0\cr}$
,$C=\pmatrix{1&1&0\cr
	      0&0&1\cr
	      1&0&0\cr}$,

\noindent
and two minimal polynomials of $\alpha$ are $t^3+t-1$
on $N_{ab}$, and $t^3-t^2-1$ on $N'$. Obviously $G$
is a torsion-free polycyclic group and it has
trivial center.

The irreducible polynomial $t^3+t-1$ has exactly one real root, say $a$.
Let $U$ be the group of algebraic units of the field ${\bf Q}(a)$.
By the Dirichlet Units Theorem $U=gp(a)\times gp(-1)\simeq $
${\bf Z}\times {\bf Z_2}$ Note that the additive group $A$ generated by
$U$ has a basis $\{ 1, a, a^2\}$, and the action of $U$ on $A$
by the left multiplication is the same as the action of
$U$ on $N_{ab}$ in the basis $\{ b_1, b_2, b_3 \}.$ Since ${\bf Q}(a)$
has trivial Galois group the group $U$ is self-normalazing
in $AutN_{ab}$ ( as in $AutA$ ) [R]. It follows that an outer
automorphism $\beta$ of $G$ normalizes $gp(\alpha )$ as a subgroup
of $AutN_{ab}$. Consequently $\beta$ induces in $N_{ab}$ an automorphism
of the form $\pm \alpha ^k,k\in {\bf N}$. Therefore we may assume that
$\beta $ induces on $N_{ab}$ either the identity or the
mapping $x\mapsto x^{-1}$. In both cases $\alpha ^{\beta}=\alpha x$
for some $x\in  N$. Since $[\alpha, N_{ab}]=N_{ab}$ because
$det(B-E)=-1$, there are $x_1 \in N$ and $z\in N'$
such that   $x=[\alpha, x_1]z$. Then we can
assume modifying $\beta$ by some inner automorphism that
$\alpha ^{\beta}=\alpha z$. In addition $[\alpha, N']=N'$
so by a similar argument we receive that $\alpha ^{\beta}=\alpha$.

After then we can consider two systems of equations corresponding to
cases: $a_i^{\beta}=a_i^{-1} d_i,$ or $a_i^{\beta}=a_i d_i$, where 
$d_i\in N', i=1,2,3.$ It follows that $d_i=1, i=1,2,3.$

$F_2(x_1,x_2)$ of rank $2$ into a finitely presented group.
It is achieved by introducing of new letters

generated, such that $C\times A\simeq C\times B$.
Then $A\simeq B$ in the following cases: $C$ and $A$ both finite

\centerline{\bf Groups with cyclic presentations.}
\bigskip

{\bf 0. Group.} Finitely presented with
 a balanced cyclic presentation
in which each defining relators involves exactly two generators
 ($G$).

{\bf Key words: } finitely presented group, cyclic presentation,
balanced presentation, Higman group, Freiheitssatz.

{\bf 1. Property.} Necessary and sufficient conditions
for cyclic presentations with $n\geq 4$ generators are given to define
a finite ( in fact cyclic ) group.

in which each defining relator involves exactly two 
generators, J.London Math. Soc. 36 (1987), 245-256.

{\bf 3. Description.}  Consider a cyclic presentation of the kind

$G = < x_1,...,x_n  | r(x_1,x_2) = ... = r(x_n,x_1) = 1 >,$

\noindent
assuming that  $r(a,b)$ is a cyclically reduced word. Denote exponent sums
as $\alpha = \sigma _a (r(a,b)), \beta = -\sigma _b (r(a,b))$, and the
group $K = < a,b | r(a,b) = 1 >$.

The group $G$ with $n \geq 4$ is finite if and only if $\alpha \not= 0$
$\not= \beta , (\alpha , \beta ) = 1, \alpha ^n \not= \beta ^n, a^{\alpha} =$
$b^{\beta} $ in $K$. In this case $G$ is cyclic of order $|\alpha ^n - \beta 
^n|$.


{\bf 4.Explanation.} Denote $K_i = < x_i,x_{i+1} | r(x_i, x_{i+1}) = 1 >$,
$( i = 1,..., n-1 ), K_n = < x_n, x_1 | r(x_n, x_1) = 1 >.$
Let $A = < x_1,..., x_{n-1} | r(x_1, x_2) = ... = r(x_{n-2}, x_{n-1}) = 1 >$
be a stem product of $K_1,..., K_{n-2}$, and $B = < x_{n-1}, x_{n}, x_1 |$
$r(x_{n-1}, x_n ) = r(x_n, x_1) = 1>$ be one of $K_{n-1}, K_n$.
The known description of one-relator  groups with a non-trivial center
gives the following conclusion: if $a^{\alpha} \not= b^ {\beta}$    
in $K$,  then $a^k \not= b^l $ for each $kl\not= 0$. Then the Freiheitssatz 
holds for
$G$ [P]: for each $X_0 \subseteq X = \{ x_1,...,x_n \}$ and
$R_0$ consisting of all defining relators written as $X_0$-words the natural 
homomoprphism $H \longrightarrow G$ is injective. Thus $G = A \ast 
_{F(x_{n-1},x_1)}B$
is an amalgamated product over the free group of rank $2$, and
so is infinite.

{\bf 5. Additional properties.} If $G$ is infinite group 
as above with $n\geq 5 $ generators, then $G$ is either cyclic or
$SQ-$universal. $G$ is cyclic if and only if $\alpha\not= 0 \not= \beta,$
$(\alpha , \beta ) = 1, a^{\alpha} = b ^{\beta}$ in $K$.

{\bf 6. Contrasts.}  The HIgman group $H = H(n) = < x_1,...,x_n |$
$x_1^{-1}x_2x_1x_2^{-2} = ... = x_n^{-1}x_1x_nx_1^{-2} = 1 >$ has a
cyclic presentation. $H(n)$ is trivial for $n\leq 3$, and infinite if $n\geq 4$.






\centerline{\bf All roots of $a^3b^6, a^pb^q (p, q $ primes).}
\bigskip

{\bf 0. Group.} Free of rank $2$ ($F_2$).

{\bf Key words: } free group, one-relator group.

{\bf 1. Property.} All roots of $a^3b^6, a^pb^q (p, q $ primes ) in
the free group $F_2 = F(a, b)$ are described.

{\bf 2. References: [S]} Steinberg A., On roots of $a^kb^l$.
Math. Z. 192(1986), 1-8.

{\bf 3. Description.}  An element $r$ is said to be a {\it root}
of an element $s$ of a free group $F$ if the normal subgroup of $F$ 
generated by $r$ contains $s : s\in gp_F (r)$.

For $p$ and $q$ both prime the only cyclically reduced roots of 
$a^pb^q$ other than $a^pb^q$ itself are $\rho (a, b)^{\pm 1},$
where $\rho (a, b)$ is a primitive in $F_2$, $\rho (a, b)$ is 
unique up to conjugation and inversion. If $p\not= q$, then
$\rho (a, b)$ has exponent sum $p$ on $a$ and $q$ on $b$;
if $p=q$ then $\rho (a, b)= ab$.

The only roots of $a^3b^6$ up to conjugation and inversion are :
$a^3b^6$ itself, $ab^2$ and $a(ab^3)^2$.

{\bf 4.Explanation.} Let $F_n = F(x_1,...,x_n)$ be a free group
of rank  $n$. By means of a succesion of Nielsen transformations
a given word $s\in F$ can be mapped onto an element having exponent
sums $\sigma _{x_i}(s)$  zero on one of $x_1,..., x_n$. Assume that
$s \not\in F_n'$, and $\sigma _{x_1}(s) = 0.$ Any root $r$ of $s$ then
lies in the normal subgroup $H\leq F$ generated by $x_2,...,x_n$,
and can be written as a product in standart free generators of $H$
$: y_{ij}=x_0^jx_ix_0^{-j}, i,j \in {\bf Z}, i\not= 0$. We can use
the Freiheitssatz of Magnus. Some polynomials arise in computing 
root $modH'$. These polynomials are associated with $r$.





{\bf 5. Additional properties.} 

{\bf 6. Contrasts.} Let $G= <a,b | a^kb^l = 1>$, then $a^k$ will be    
in the center of $G$. Moreover if a root $r$ of $s$ is not a root of 
any word in the center of $G$, then the group $K= <a, b | r= 1>$
will have a nontrivial center. It has been conjugated that any
one-relator group with center is one of the groups $K$ above.






{\bf Finitely generated non quasi-convex subgroup in hyperbolic three-manifold 
group}

{\bf 0. Group.} Finitely generated subgroup in hyperbolic three-manifold group
({\bf $H \leq G $}).

{\bf Key words:}{\it  quasi-convex subgroup, hyperbolic group, three-manifold 
group,
finitely generated subgroup.}

{\bf 1. Property.} $ H $ is not quasi-convex in $G$, i.e. for some Cayley graph
$\Gamma = \Gamma (G,S), S = S^{-1}$, for every constant $k$ there exists a 
geodesic segment $I_k$ in $\Gamma$ joined two points of $H$ that does not stay 
in a $k$-neighbourhood of $H$ in $\Gamma $.

{\bf 3. Description. } ( follow to J\o rgensen and Thurston, see{\bf [P]}).
Let $M$ be a closed hyperbolic  three-manifold which fibres over the circle with 
fibre a closed surface of genus two. Let $G = \pi _1 (M), $ and let $S = S^{-1}$ 
be a finite generator system for $G$. Then $H$ be the fundamental group 
of the fibre. 

{\bf 4. Explanation.} Assume that $T\subset  S$ is a finite generator system for 
$H$. For the three dimensional hyperbolic space 
{\bf H} the monodromy action gives a quasi-isometry $\Gamma (G,S) \rightarrow 
H$, and we obtain a commutative diagram

$   \begin{array}{ccc} 
       

\Gamma (G,S ) & \rightarrow  & {\bf H} \\
\downarrow &          & \downarrow\\
\Gamma(H,T) & \rightarrow & {\bf H}
\end{array}  $ 


\noindent where the left vertical arrow is the inclusion map and the right 
vertical is the identity map.

At infinity we obtain in the case if $H$ is quasi-convex in $G$ a topological  
commutative diagram

$ \begin{array}{ccc}

\partial G  &   \rightarrow & L_G \\
\uparrow &    &  \uparrow\\
\partial H & \rightarrow & L_H\\
\end{array}  $

\noindent where $\partial H$ and $\partial G$ are Gromov boundaries, and write 
$L_H$ and $L_G$ are limit sets in the 
${\bf S^2}$. The vertical arrows are inclusion maps and the horizontal ones are 
homeomorphisms. As 
$H$ is normal, $L_H$ is $G$-invariant., but the action of $G$ on ${\bf S^2}$ is 
minimal, so $L_H = L_G$. 
This implies a contaradictory 

${\bf S^1} \simeq   \partial H \simeq L_H = L_G = {\bf S^2}.$

{\bf 5. Additional properties.}

{\bf 6. Contrasts.} In a hyperbolic surface group, a subgroup is finitely 
generated iff it is quasi-convex.
