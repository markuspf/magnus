    A graphically-oriented software system for 
        computational group theory 


================================================================

The MAGNUS  Computational Group Theory Package is an innovative
symbolic algebra package providing facilities for doing calculations
in and about infinite groups.  Almost all symbolic algebra systems
are oriented toward finite computations that are guaranteed to
produce answers, given enough time and resources.  By contrast,
MAGNUS is concerned with experiments and computations on infinite
groups which in some cases are known to terminate, while in others are
known to be generally recursively unsolvable.



Features
------------

- A graphical object and method based user interface which  is easy 
 and intuitive to use and naturally reflects the underlying  C++ 
 classes;

- A kernel comprised of a ``session manager",  to communicate between
 the user interface or front-end and the back-end where computations
 are carried out, and ``computation managers" which direct the
 computations which may involve several algorithms and ``information 
 centers"  where information is stored;

- Facilities for performing several procedures in parallel and
 allocating resources to each of several simultaneous algorithms
 working on the same problem;

- Enumerators which generate sizable finite approximations to  both 
 finite and infinite algebraic objects and make it possible  to carry 
 out searches for answers  even when general algorithms may not exist;

- Innovative genetic algorithms;

- A package manager to ``plug in" more special purpose algorithms
 written by others;

Documentation and Other Resources
---------------------------------
There is some documentation in the `doc' subdirectory of the
distribution. As usual, this could be vastly improved.

MAGNUS is available from

  http://www.grouptheory.org

There are two contact e-mail addresses:
- for general comments and suggestions about Magnus send e-mail to: 
     comment@rio.sci.ccny.cuny.edu 
- bug reports, with a brief description of the group being tested 
and the tool that was buggy, should be sent to: 
     bug@rio.sci.ccny.cuny.edu 

Supported Platforms
-------------------
MAGNUS can be successfully compiled with gcc 2.95.3. The later 
versions of GCC compiler do not support previous releases. We are 
working on porting MAGNUS to gcc 3.02 but it will take some time.

MAGNUS has been tested on the following platforms:

      Red Hat / SuSE Linux 2.2 (2.4) (Tcl/Tk 8.x)
	     - Should run on other comparable Linuxes as well

      We have old binary releases for Solaris 2.5 and SunOs4.1.3 
available at http://www.grouptheory.org

Installation
------------
Installation is described in the file INSTALL in the this directory.

History
-------
There is a ChangeLog file which describes changes for each MAGNUS' 
release available in the same directory.
