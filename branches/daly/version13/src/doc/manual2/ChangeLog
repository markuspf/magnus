Version 4.1.1 beta (01/11/2002) Major Changes:

- Database added. Now it is possible to store examples of groups and
  their descriptions in the Database as well as save and rstore objects
  in the Workspace.

- Package Mechanism. MAGNUS' Package Mechanism was developed to provide 
  a simple and convenient way of integrating second party software into 
  MAGNUS' graphical user interface. See doc/PackagesManual.ps for more
  details.

- MAGNUS' menus were changed

- Random definitions when cheking in objects are available. 

- George Havas' version of Todd-Coxeter procedure is incorporated.

=====================================================================

Version 3.2.1 pre-release(11/24/99) Major Changes:

 - Source code is compliant with the recent version of C++ draft and
can be compiled by egcs-1.1.2 - the version of GNU compiler included
in Linux 6.0 and 6.1 disrtibutions.

 -  Class templates implementation is simplified, so that it is easier
to compile Magnus under different platforms.

 - New genetic algorithms for:
       *  Whitehead reduction for tuples of words in a free group.
       *  Andrews-Curtis reduction for tuples  of words in a free group.

- New algorithms for free groups:
       * For group F and word W:

- Genetic algorithm for solving problem "Is word part of a basis?".

- Genetic algorithm for solving product of two commutators problem.

         generators(details will be provided by a link to a file).

       * For one relator group G and word W:
       * Word problem(details will be provided by a link to a file).

       * "Re-write word as a product of commutators".
       * "Rewrite word as a product of squares".

- For a finitely presented group G and a subgroup H of finite index,
  there is a new algorithm:

======================================================================

Version 2.9.0 pre-release(04/18/98) Changes and Enhancements:

- New genetic algorithms for finitely presented groups:
    For group G:
       * Is G trivial?
       * Is G abelian?

    For words w, w1, w2:
       * Is w central?

       * Word enumerator.
       * Relator enumerator.
       * Automorphisms enumerator for free groups.
       * Relator enumerator for a subgroup.
       * Make a list of words from an enumerator.

      * Find a word in a list.
      * Extract all words from the defined  length range.

==========================================================================

Version 2.8.4 pre-release(02/13/98) Changes and Enhancements:
 
- Magnus menus now change dynamically to reflect the information found
about objects. For example, if a group is found to be abelian then the
menu for it will change, so that new "abelian" algorithms are
accessible.
- Existing genetic algorithms for finitely presented  groups (word problem,
triviality problem, "is a group abelian ?" problem) and for solving equations
in a free group were modified to show better performance.
- Many message misprints were corrected.
- New pages were added to the magnus manual. Many broken links were
fixed.
- The description of the format used for a finite state automaton is now
available.
- Magnus manual and workspace manual work on every supported system now.
- As of now, Linux 5.0 and Tcl/Tk 8.0 are fully supported. Magnus
compiles and runs cleanly.
- For now, "Is Finite" and "Order" problems for FP groups
are identical.  This  means that both use all related fast checks and
algorithms to solve the problem. This situation will change.
- One may now compute the conjugate of one word by another.
- One may now compute the length of a word in freely reduced form.
- One may now compute the commutator of two words.

=============================================================================

Version 2.8.0 pre-release(01/08/98) Changes and Enhancements:

- The genetic algorithm for solving the word problem in a finitely presented 
group has been optimized.
- Computational details for the Nielsen basis for a subgroup of a free group 
have been added.
- Some bugs have been fixed in the algorithm for solving quadratic equations 
over a free group.
- For one-relator groups found to have torsion, we have added the following 
  algorithms:
         * A word which is trivial in the given group is re-expressed as a 
           product of conjugates of the defining relator (and its inverse).
         * A word which represents an element of finite order is re-expressed 
           as a conjugate of a power of r, where here r^n is the given defining 
           relator.
         * A process which enumerates all consequences of the given defining 
           relator.

- A process which enumerates all of the relations that are satisfied by the given
 generators of a finitely generated subgroup of a finitely presented roup.

==============================================================================

- Genetic algorithm for the triviality problem.
- Genetic algorithm for the abelian problem.
- Genetic algorithm for solving equations over a free group.
- Find a permutation representation of G on the cosets of H in G.
- Compute the Schreier representative of an element of G.
- Compute a Schreier transversal of H in G.
