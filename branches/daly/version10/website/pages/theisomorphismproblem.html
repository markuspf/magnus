<H3> The Isomorphism Problem</h3>

<font size=4>
Is there an algorithm which determines whether or not any pair of groups
(in some well-defined class of groups) given by finite presentations are
isomorphic?
<br>
<br>
There is no general algorithm to solve this problem for all finite
presentations. Magnus has several algorithms which can be applied
to a finite presentation to attempt to decide this question for a
particular finite presentation.
<br>
<br>

We have already noted that if <em>G</em> is the group defined by the
finite presentation &lt; <em>X</em> ; <em>R</em> &gt;, then there is
no algorithm which decides whether or not any finite presentation
&lt; <em>Y</em> ; <em>R</em> &gt; also defines <em>G</em>. In
practice, one is often confronted not by an algorithmic problem, but a
simple question: given two finite presentations
&lt; <em>X</em> ; <em>R</em> &gt; and
&lt; <em>Y</em> ; <em>R</em> &gt;, do they define isomorphic groups?
If we denote the group presented by 
&lt; <em>X</em> ; <em>R</em> &gt; by <em>G</em> and that presented by
&lt; <em>Y</em> ; <em>R</em> &gt; by <em>H</em>, then we are asking
whether <em>G</em> is isomorphic to <em>H</em>. Now it follows from a
theorem of Tietze that we can enumerate all of the finite
presentations of <em>G</em> and all of those of <em>H</em>.
Consequently, if <em>G</em> and <em>H</em> are isomorphic, given
enough time and space, we will eventually find this out (granted that
we have coded a procedure to carry out such enumerations). Of course,
if <em>G</em> and <em>H</em> are note isomorphic, this procedure will
not tell us anything. There are, however, other things that we can
try. For instance, we can, in many cases only to a limited extent,
check whether <em>G</em> and <em>H</em> have
<ul>
<li>the same abelianisations,
<li>the same nilpotent quotients,
<li>the same metabelian quotients,
<li>the same finite images,
<li>the same number of subgroups of a given finite index,
<li>the same integral homology groups,
<li>finite rewriting systems,
<li>automatic structures
<li>affine algebraic sets of representations into <em>SL_2(C)</em> with the
same dimensions,
<li>the same elements of finite order
</ul>
<br>
<br>
If we are able successfully to obtain some conflicting information
then we will know that <em>G</em> and <em>H</em> are not
isomorphic. The way, as well as the order, in which we carry out these
tasks can be viewed as the design and implementation of the kind of
experiment about <em>G</em> and <em>H</em> that we have been alluding
to above. There are many variations on such a design. For example, we
might try to compute the set <em>Hom(G,T)</em> of all homomorphisms of
<em>G</em> into some nice target group <em>T</em> for 10 seconds and
then try to compute the corresponding set <em>Hom(H,T)</em>, also for
10 seconds. If the cardinality of these two sets is vastly different,
this would <em>suggest</em> that <em>G</em> and <em>H</em> are not
isomorphic. We would also put similar time constraints on some of the
procedures above or any new ones we can devise, which might give us
some indication as to whether &lt; <em>Y</em> ; <em>R</em> &gt; are
isomorphic. At present Magnus does not provide access to all these
procedures. However we hope that, in due course, it will provide
access to all of them.
