<h3>General discussion</h3>

Every finitely generated abelian group can be decomposed into a direct
product of finitely many infinite cyclic groups and finitely many
cyclic groups of finite order. Since each such group is given by
finitely many generators and finitely many defining relators in the
category of abelian groups, i.e., as a quotient of a free abelian
group of finite rank by a subgroup generated by finitely many
elements, such a decomposition can be obtained by Gaussian
Elimination. If one is interested in a decomposition involving the
least number of factors, the resultant decomposition is called the
canonical decomposition. In this case the orders of the finite cyclic
factors are arranged according to magnitude, with each such dividing
the succeeding one. If one is interested in a decomposition involving
only cyclic groups of prime-power order, the finite cyclic factors are
arranged in batches. All of the cyclic groups are of prime-power
order.  The first batch of cyclic factors constitute the Sylow
p-subgroup of the group, where the prime is the largest of all the
primes that occur and, in this batch, the cyclic factors are arranged
in decreasing order. The second batch of cyclic groups involves the
next largest prime and again the cyclic groups in this batch are
arranged in decreasing order of magnitude. The remaining batches are
arranged similarly. This decomposition is usually termed the primary
decomposition of the given abelian group.
<br>
<br>
The number of infinite cyclic groups in either one of these
decompositions is an invariant, termed the torsion-free rank of the
abelian group. Similarly, the number of cyclic groups in the canonical
decomposition, the primes occurring in the primary decomposition and
the orders of the cyclic factors are also invariants. This data allows
us to solve a variety of problems about finitely generated abelian
groups, such as the isomorphism problem, whether a given abelian group
is finite and so on.
<br>
<br>
Every subgroup of a finitely generated abelian group can also be
decomposed in the same way. This allows us to solve a number of
problems involving subgroups of abelian groups. These decompositions
can also be chosen so that they dovetail with a decompsition of the
containing group, which then allows for answering such questions as to
whether a subgroup is isolated, is a direct factor and so on.
<br>
<br>
Any word in the generators of a given abelian group can be
re-expressed in terms of the generators of one or other of these
decompositions. In the first instance, the resultant expression is
called the canonical decomposition of the word and in the second it is
called the primary decomposition. Depending on the nature of the
question that is being asked, such expressions, which are unique, can
be used to solve a number of questions about words in abelian groups,
such as whether they represent the trivial element, whether they are
are of finite or infinite order and so on.

<h3>Tools Menu</h3>
Magnus is structured around answering specific questions. For abelian
groups the questions fall into 4 categories. Once an abelian group
is selected the tools menu displays:

<h3>General discussion about homology</h3>

The canonical decomposition of a finitely generated abelian group can
be used to completely determine its homology on making use of the
so-called Kunneth formula. The Kunneth formula is a formula which
gives the integral homology of a direct product of two groups in terms
of tensor products of the integral homology of the factors.
<br>
<br>
<h3>General discussion about morphisms</h3>

The canonical decompositions of a finitely generated abelian group and
that of it subgroups allow us to easily decide a number of questions
about morphisms of abelian groups, such as whether a map from the
generators of one abelian group into a second abelian group can be
continued to a homomorphism, whether such a homomorphism is a
monomorphism, an epimorphism, an isomorphism and so on.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Find the primary (canonical) decomposition </h3>

Every finitely generated abelian group can be decomposed into a direct
product of finitely many infinite cyclic groups and finitely many
cyclic groups of finite order. Since each such group is given by
finitely many generators and finitely many defining relators in the
category of abelian groups, i.e., as a quotient of a free abelian
group of finite rank by a subgroup generated by finitely many
elements, such a decomposition can be obtained by Gaussian
Elimination. This decomposition can be arranged so that the finite
cyclic groups are all of prime-power order, arranged in classes. The
first class involves the cyclic factors where the prime appearing is
the largest of all and the cyclic factors are arranged in decreasing
order. The second class involves the next biggest prime and so
on. This decomposition is usually termed the primary decomposition of
the given abelian group.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Find the torsion-free rank</h3>

The given group is decomposed into a direct product of finitely many
cyclic groups. The number of infinite cyclic groups is the
torsion-free rank of the group.  For a general discussion on finitely
generated abelian groups, see @General
discussion@General_abelian_groups::General discussion@
<br>
<br>

<h3>Compute the integral homology</h3>

The given group is decomposed into a direct product of cyclic groups.
Its integral homology groups can be obtained by the so-called Kunneth
formula which describes the integral homology groups of a direct
product of two groups in terms of the integral homology groups of the
factors. Since the homology of cyclic groups is easy to obtain, this
makes it possible to compute the homology groups of any finitely
generated abelian group.  For a general discussion on finitely
generated abelian groups, see @General
discussion@General_abelian_groups::General discussion@
<br>
<br>

<h3>The word problem</h3>

In order to see if a word is trivial we compute its canonical 
decomposition. 
<br>
<br>

For a general discussion about finitely generated abelian groups,
see @General discussion@General_abelian_groups::General discussion@.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Equality of two words </h3>

In order to determine whether the elements represented by two words
are equal, we compute their canonical decompositions. The elements are
equal if and only if their canonical decompositions coincide. For a
general discussion see @General
discussion@General_abelian_groups::General discussion@.
<br>
<br>

<h3>The power problem</h3>

In order to see if an element is a proper power, we compute
a maximal root of the element. This comes equipped with a positive
integer giving us the power of the maximal root that coincides with
the given element. If that power is greater than 1, the element is
a proper power, otherwise it is not.For a general discussion, see
@General discussion@General_abelian_groups::General discussion@.

<h3>Maximal root of an element</h3>

In order to compute the maximal root of an element, we first compute
its primary decomposition. If the element is of finite order, then it
does not have a maximal root. The maximal root of an element of the
form a^m, where a is an element of infinite order, is a and if a is of
p-power order, then a maximal p-power root of a^n, if a^n is not the
identity element, is a^(n/p^j), where p^j is the biggest power of p
dividing n. A maximal root of any given element of infinite order can
then be read off from its primary decomposition. For a general
discussion, see @General discussion@General_abelian_groups::General
discussion@.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Primary (canonical) form of an element</h3>

We first find the primary decomposition of the given group -
see @General discussion@General_abelian_groups::General discussion@.
Each of the generators occuring in the given word is then 
re-expressed in terms of the new generators that have been
obtained in the primary decomposition, leading to a representation
of the given word in terms of the primary decomposition, i.e.,
its primary (canonical) form.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Find the p-height of an element of p-power order</h3>

In order to compute the p-height of an element, we compute its primary
decomposition - see @Primary (canonical) form of an
element@General_abelian_groups:: Primary (canonical) form of an
element@.  If the element is of finite order prime to p, its p-height
is infinite. Otherwise, its p-height can be read off from is primary
decomposition. It is enough to note that if a is an element of either
infinite order or of p-power order, then the p-height of a^n is the
largest power of p dividing n, whenever a^n is not equal to 1.


<h3>Subgroup membership problem </h3>

In order to see if an element is in a subgroup, we add the generators
of the subgroup to the defining relations of the containing group and then
check to see if the image of the given  element is trivial in the resultant 
group. For a general discussion, see
@General discussion@General_abelian_groups::General discussion@.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Power of an element in a subgroup?</h3>

In order to see if a power of an element lies in a subgroup,
we add the generators of the subgroup to the relators of the containing
group and check to see if the image of the element is of finite order
in the resultant quotient group. For a general discussion, see
@General discussion@General_abelian_groups::General discussion@.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Subgroup containment problem </h3>

In order to see if one subgroup is contained in another, we check if
all of the generators of the first subgroup are contained in the
second - see @Subgroup membership problem@General_abelian_groups::
Subgroup membership problem@.  If so, then the first subgroup is
contained in the second; otherwise not.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Subgroup equality problem</h3>

In order to see if two subgroups are equal we check to see if the
first is contained in the second and then whether the second subgroup
is contained in the first, using an existing algorithm.  See @Subgroup
containment problem@General_abelian_groups::Subgroup containment
problem@.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Order of a subgroup</h3>

The given subgroup is decomposed into a direct product
of cyclic groups. If there are no infinite cyclic factors
in this decomposition, the subgroup is finite. Otherwise
it is infinite. For a general discussion, see
@General discussion@General_abelian_groups::General discussion@.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Index of a subgroup </h3>

The index of the given subgroup in the overgroup 
is the order of the factor group of the overgroup by
the subgroup. We use here the algorithm that computes
the order of a given finitely generated abelian group - see 
@Order of a subgroup@General_abelian_groups::Order of a subgroup@. 
<br>
<br>

<h3>Virtual free complement for a subgroup </h3>

Pre-images of the elements of infinite order in a canonical
decomposition of the factor group of the containing group by the
subgroup give a virtual complement of the subgroup.
For a general discussion, see
@General discussion@General_abelian_groups::General discussion@.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Canonical basis for a subgroup</h3>

The canonical decomposition of a subgroup can be obtained by
first using the presentation of its overgroup to obtain a presentation
of the subgroup. This allows us to find its canonical decomposition 
by Gaussian elimination as usual. For a general discussion, see
@General discussion@General_abelian_groups::General discussion@.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Basis for subgroup giving primary decomposition</h3>

The primary decomposition of a subgroup can be obtained by first
finding a presentation for it and then using the algorithm for finding
the primary decomposition for a given finitely generated abelian
group. See @Find the primary (canonical)
decomposition@General_abelian_groups:: Find the primary (canonical)
decomposition@.
<br>
<br>

<h3>Basis for subgroup compatible with containing group</h3>

See @General discussion@General_abelian_groups::General discussion@.

<h3>Join of two subgroups </h3>

We simply join the two sets of generators of the repsective subgroups
together, thereby producing generators for the join of the two subgroups.

<h3>Isolator of a subgroup</h3>

The isolator of a given subgroup is the pre-image of the torsion
subgroup of the factor group of the given group by the subgroup. The torsion
subgroup is computed using an existing algorithm. See 
@General discussion@General_abelian_groups::General discussion@.

<h3>Is a subgroup pure?</h3>

In order to see if an element generates a pure subgroup, we compute
the primary decomposition of the element. If there are both infinite
cyclic and finite cyclic factors involved, then the element does not
generate a pure subgroup. If there are only infinite cyclic groups
involved and the group is torsion-free, then the subgroup generated by
the element is pure only if it is not a proper power.  If no infinite
cyclic factors are involved, then the subgroup generated by the
element is pure only if the p-heights of its p-primary components are
always 1 in each sylow p-subgroup.  For a general discussion, see
@General discussion@General_abelian_groups::General discussion@.


<h3>Is a subgroup an automorphic image of another?</h3>

See @General discussion about morphisms@General_abelian_groups::
General discussion about morphisms@. 

<h3>Can a map be extended to a homomorphism?</h3>

See @General discussion about morphisms@General_abelian_groups::
General discussion about morphisms@. 

<h3>Is a homomorphism injective? </h3>

See @General discussion about morphisms@General_abelian_groups::
General discussion about morphisms@. 

<h3>Is a homomorphism surjective?</h3>

See @General discussion about morphisms@General_abelian_groups::
General discussion about morphisms@. 

<h3>Is a homomorphism  an isomorphism?</h3>

See @General discussion about morphisms@General_abelian_groups::
General discussion about morphisms@. 

<h3>Is an endomorphism  an automorphism?</h3>

See @General discussion about morphisms@General_abelian_groups::
General discussion about morphisms@. 

<h3>Enumerating automorphisms of a free abelian group</h3>

See @General discussion about morphisms@General_abelian_groups::
General discussion about morphisms@. 

<h3>Product of two automorphisms of a free abelian group</h3>

We compute the composition of the two maps in the given order on the
generators of the given group. This defines the product of the two
automorphisms.

<h3>Order of an automorphism of a free abelian group</h3>

Automorphisms of the free abelian group of rank n are in one-to-one
correspondence with matrices from the group GL_n(Z).  There is a bound
for the order of a torsion element in GL_n(Z), hence also for the
order of an automorphism of a free abelian group.  Now the problem is
reduced to checking finitely many powers of a given automorphism for
being the identity automorphism.
