<H3> The Conjugacy Problem</h3>

<font size=4>
Given a finite presentation <b><em>P</em></b> of a group 
<b><em>G</em></b> and given two 
words <em>U</em>, <em>V</em> defining elements
<em>u</em>, <em>v</em> of <b><em>G</em></b>, the <b>Conjugacy Problem</b>
is to decide if <em>U</em> is conjugate to <em>V</em>. There is no
general algorithm which, given <b><em>P</em></b>, <em>U</em> and <em>V</em>,
can decide this question.
<br>
<br>
There is no general algorithm to solve this problem for all finite
presentations. Magnus has several algorithms which can be applied
to a finite presentation to attempt to decide this question for a
particular finite presentation.
<br>
<br>
Suppose that we are given a finite presentation<br>
<center>
G=&lt; x_1,...x_n | r_1 = 1, ..., r_m = 1 &gt;
</center>
<br>
and that we are interested in determining whether or not two X-words 
<em>u</em> and <em>v</em> are conjugate in <em>G</em>, where
X={x_1,...,x_n}. Such a problem might arise for instances if <em>u</em>
and <em>v</em> represent two closed loops in a finite complex and we
want to know whether they are freely homotopic.
<br>
<br>
Now if the conjugacy problem for <em>G</em> is unsolvable, then there
is no algorithm which decides whether or not <em>any</em> pair of
X-words represent conjugate elements of <em>G</em>. The situation is
different if we consider just two words <em>u</em> and
<em>v</em>. From an algorithmic standpoint, the problem as to whether
<em>u</em> and <em>v</em> represent conjugate elements of <em>G</em>
is solvable. There is only one question being asked and its answer is
either "Yes" or "No". The only difficulty is that we do not know what
the answer is! It is worth-while to examine what it is that is
involved. To this end, let <em>R</em> denote the normal closure in the
free group <em>F</em> on <em>X</em> of the elements r_1,...r_m. If we
identify <em>G</em> with <em>F/R</em>, then <em>u</em> is conjugate to
<em>v</em> in <em>G</em> if and only if there exists an X-word c_0 and
an X-word r_0, and element of <em>R</em> such that<br>
<center>
u = x_0^-1 v x_0 r_0
</center>
<br>
Let <em>H_0</em> be the subgroup generated by r_1,...r_m, <em>H_1</em>
the subgroup generated by <em>H_0</em> together with the conjugates of
its generators x_i^(+1) and x_i^(-1), and so on. If follows that
<em>R</em> can be expressed as an ascending union of these finitely
generated subgroups <em>H_i</em> (i=0,1,...) and hence is recursively
enumerable. From our standpoint, we would like to view this sequence
of finitely generated subgroups as better and better approximations to
<em>R</em>, the larger the value of <em>i</em>, the better the
approximation. We can enumerate all products of the form 
x^-1 v x r, where <em>x</em> ranges over <em>F</em> and <em>r</em>
ranges over <em>R</em>. Now given a finitely generated subgroup
<em>L</em> of a finitely generated free group <em>F</em> freely
generated by <em>X</em> there is a finite state automation <em>A</em>
over <em>X</em> such that the set of freely reduced words belonging to
<em>L</em> comprises the language of <em>A</em>. This implies that
there is an algorithm for determining membership in <em>L</em>. In
particular, there is for each <em>i</em>, a finite state automaton
<em>A_i</em> which decides membership in <em>H_i</em>. More generally,
there is, for each <em>i</em> an analogous automaton which decides
whether <em>u</em> is congugate to <em>v</em>, module <em>H_i</em>,
i.e., whether there is an X-word <em>x</em> such that 
x^-1 u x is and element of v<em>H_i</em>. If there is such a word
<em>x</em>, then <em>u</em> and <em>v</em> are conjugate in <em>G</em>
by <em>x</em>. If this is not the case and if <em>i</em> is reasonably
large, then this suggests that <em>u</em> and <em>v</em> are not conjugate
in <em>G</em>. Magnus provides the tools to carry out this procedure,
once again if time and space permit. The discussion of the isomorphism
problem above, indicates that further experimentation is possible. One
can check whether <em>u</em> and <em>v</em> represent elements of
<em>G</em> which perhaps are not conjugate modulo some term of the
lower central series of <em>G</em>, or modulo the second derived group
of <em>G</em> or module some normal subgroup of finite index in
<em>G</em>, or, more generally, in some homomorphic image of
<em>G</em>. We might try to find a finite rewriting system for
<em>G</em>, or an automatic structure or a bi-automatic structure and,
if we are successful, use the additional knowledge about <em>G</em> to
launch some further experiments. Magnus at present provides some of
these options. It will eventually be more fully equipped. The point of
the matter is that although these computer experiments may be
inconclusive, an examination of the results of such experiments may
provide some guidance, leading the researcher to obtain definitive
answers by sifting through the evidence collected.
