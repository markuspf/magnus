  A System for Exploring Infinite Groups
  </font>

  <font size=4>
Magnus is a special purpose computer algebra system designed to carry out
experiments with infinite groups. These infinite groups come, in the main,
equipped with finite presentations. There are 3 canonical classes of
problems (
<a href="pages/thewordproblem.html">the Word Problem</a>,
<a href="pages/theconjugacyproblem.html">the Conjugacy Problem</a>, and
<a href="pages/theisomorphismproblem.html">the Isomorphism Problem</a>)
which have been shown to have no general
algorithmic solution for finitely presented groups. Occasionally a
fourth problem, 
<a href="pages/thesubgroupproblem.html">the Subgroup Problem</a>), is
cited.
However, given a 
particular group it is often possible to obtain a solution. There are
many procedures which may or may not terminate with a solution.
  <br>
  <br>
Magnus is designed to take an experimental approach to working with
these finitely presented groups. The philosophy is to consider a group
as an object to which we can apply a range of procedures to extract
properties of the group. For example if we can find a canonical 
decomposition of a group then we can conclude that the group, as given
by the finite presentation, is free abelian. 
  <br>
  <br>
Magnus has a novel approach for interactions called a zero-learning
curve interface. Since almost nothing is known about a given group
the user is free to experiment by choosing tools to apply to the group.
All menus and help are context sensitive. The groups are presented on
a "workbench" where they can be manipulate, probed, and the results
can be cataloged for later use.

<a href="pages/checkinabeliangroup.html">Abelian Group Questions</a>
gives a general discussion of some of the questions and definitions
that arise. From here you can follow some examples of how to answer
such questions using Magnus.

A group G is said to be an 
<a href="pages/checkinamalgamatedproduct.html">amalgamated product</a> of its 
subgroups A and B with the subgroup H amalgamated, if 
(i) G is generated by A and B, termed the factors;
(ii) A and B intersect in H, termed the amalgamated subgroup;
(iii) every product of the form c_1 c_2 ... c_n, where c_i is
not the identity,  each c_i is in the union of A and B,  
and consecutive terms c_i lie in diferent factors, is different
from the identity.
