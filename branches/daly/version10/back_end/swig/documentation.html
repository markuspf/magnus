<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p>
The purpose of this document is to give a brief introduction to
the ideas, and techniques behind the nascent scripting interface
for Magnus. The goal is to create an application programming
interface (API) that exposes the full power and flexibility
of Magnus's underlying C++ code without forcing users to master
the complexity of the code. Scripting is the way to accomplish
this. John Ousterhout has written a beautiful <a
href="http://www.scriptics.com/people/john.ousterhout/scripting.html">
article</a> about the power of scripting.
</p>

<p>
There are several scripting languages, each with its own distinctive
set of advantages and disadvantages. My scripting language of choice
is <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>.
I prefer Python because of its power and its remarkably
clear syntax. Python has been referred to as 'executable pseudocode',
which is pretty close to the truth. Moreover, it is easy to learn, so
I believe that a Python interface will allow even nonprogrammers to
perform computer experiments with Magnus. With a scripting interface,
it will be possible to use Magnus to perform a large number of
experiments as a batch job (as opposed to the current graphical user
interface that requires users to basically initiate every single
computation with a click of the mouse). This, in turn, will open up
a whole new base of sophisticated users.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, the scripting interface will not require any changes to
the existing C++ code. Rather, it takes the usual Magnus libraries
and ties them together with external wrapper code. In particular,
this means that the scripting interface will coexist peacefully
with the session manager as well as the graphical user interface.
</p>

<p>
The wrapper code that turns Magnus into an extension of Python is
generated by a tool called <a href="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a>
for 'Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator'. SWIG also offers
a number of smart constructs for converting Python's high-level data
structures into Magnus's vectors and vice versa. The design of a useful
and user-friendly scripting interface, however, still requires a fair
amount of human judgment.
</p>



<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
Here's an example of an interactive Python session with Magnus (I swear
I didn't make this up):
</p>

<pre>
Python 1.5.2 (#1, Aug 25 2000, 09:33:37)  [GCC 2.96 20000731 (experimental)] on linux-i386
Copyright 1991-1995 Stichting Mathematisch Centrum, Amsterdam
>>> import Magnus
>>> F=Magnus.FreeGroup(5)
>>> w1=Magnus.WordFromList([1,2,3])
>>> w2=Magnus.WordFromList([1,2,3,4,-3])
>>> for w in F.nielsenBasis([w1,w2]):
...     print w
... 
[ 1 2 3 ]
[ 3 -4 ]
>>> 
</pre>

<p>
It may not look like much, but there's a lot going on behind the
scenes. First, Magnus becomes a part of Python. Then, we create
a free group _as a Python object_! Then, we create two words from
lists of integers (note that this means that our scripting interface
has automatically converted those into vectors of objects of type
Generator), and then we loop over a list of words that constitutes
a Nielsen basis of the subgroup defined by a Python list of two
words.
</p>

<p>
Also, imagine you had to recreate the same result interaction with
Magnus in C++. The code would be a lot longer, and you would have
to compile it, link it, ...
</p>



<h3>The state of affairs</h3>


<p>
The results of this one week of hacking present a rather convincing
proof of concept --- even though currently only a small subset of all
Magnus classes is scriptable, I believe that the hard problems have
been solved (Alex Miasnikov's contribution was crucial), and I am confident
that the completion of the scripting interface is only a matter of
weeks, given enough man power. The remainder of this document outlines
the strategies and techniques needed to complete the job.
</p>



<h3>SWIG and the scripting interface</h3>


<p>
Warning: SWIG is a large and complex piece of software. It
pays to read the <a href="http://www.swig.org/Doc1.1/HTML/Contents.html">
manual</a>  carefully before doing anything at all.
This document is not supposed to replace the manual.
</p>

<p>
SWIG looks at interface files (extension .i) in order to find out how
to construct the scripting interface. Essentially, the scripting interface
_is_ the collection of .i files.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Convention:</strong> Interface files live in directories called 'swig',
e.g., back_end/swig, back_end/Elt/swig, back_end/Group/swig, etc.
</p>

<p>
The directory back_end/swig contains two files that play a special role:
</p>

<ul>
	<li> Magnus.i: This is the top-level interface file that merely
		includes the other .i files. After creating a new .i file,
		you need to add the line '%include newfile.i' to Magnus.i.</li>
	<li> Magnustypes.i: This file contains the rules for conversions from
		Python types to Magnus types and back. This is the most
		crucial as well as difficult part of the entire scripting
		interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The remaining swip directories contain .i files that are derived from
the corresponding .h files. The files back_end/Elt/swig/Word.i and
back_end/Group/swig/FreeGroup.i are good illustrations of how a
.i file arises from a .h file. Basically, you have to adjust the
preamble (don't forget to include the corresponding .h file),
resolve name conflicts with SWIG's '%name' directive, decide which
methods to comment out and which methods to expose to the scripting
interface, and create additional methods with SWIG's '%addmethods'
directive. Good candidates for '%addmethods' are definitions of
Python's special methods, as well as methods that make life easier
for Python programmers (such as 'FreeGroupFromString' in
back_end/Group/swig/FreeGroup.i).
</p>

<p>
The following rules seem to helpful:
</p>

<ol>
	<li> Delete all nonpublic methods, including friend methods.
	SWIG only works with public methods (that's no problem because
	Python programmers should not be concerned with internal affairs
	of C++ objects anyway).</li>

	<li> Don't delete any public methods or fields. If you don't want
	to expose them, comment them out. Like this, it's easier to put
	them back in if you change your mind.</li>

	<li> Don't rely on inheritance --- if you think an inherited
	method should be available, make sure it appears in the .i
	file, even if it is already contained in the .i file of the
	superclass. (I have no good understanding of why inheritance
	doesn't work; maybe SWIG doesn't understand the DerivedObject
	trick of Magnus) </li>

	<li> If a public method may at all be useful for Python
	programmers, make it available. </li>

	<li> Don't make it available if it doesn't add value. For
	example, the class Word has a constructor
		Word( const VectorOf<Generator>& v )
	and another constructor
		Word( const ListOf<Generator>& l );
	From the point of view of Python, those two are the same, so
	we need only one of them. </li>

	<li> Make sure that the parameters and return value of each method
	are either simple or handled by the typemaps in Magnustypes.i.
	Creating typemaps is not trivial, so make sure it's worth the
	trouble (this rule may conflict with Rule 4...). </li>

	<li> When introducing new methods, choose descriptive names that
	take the point of view of Python. For example, the constructor
	WordFromList([..]) might have been called Word_vector because
	it calls the C++ constructor that takes a vector as a parameter.
	However, Python users won't know this; from their point of view,
	they're constructing a word from a list, so that's what the name
	should reflect.</li>
</ol>



<h3>Typemaps</h3>


<p>
Typemaps can be tricky. The SWIG manual covers them in some detail,
and the file back_end/swig/Magnustypes.i contains detailed and
documented examples of how to go about converting types. I had to
spend a lot of time meditating on the <a
href="http://www-cad.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pinhong/scriptEDA/pyTypemapFAQ.html">
typemap FAQ</a>  as well as the <a
href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/api/api.html">
Python/C API</a> in order to solve some of the problems I
encountered. In particular, when building complex typemaps,
the implementations of '%typemap(python,in) VectorOf&'
and '%typemap(python,out) VectorOf' may be a good starting
point.
</p>



<h3>Building the shared library</h3>


<p>
The file back_end/buildso is a short script that runs SWIG on the
.i files, compiles the wrapper code and links everything with the
Magnus libraries. Make sure the libraries have been compiled with
the -fpic option of g++ so they'll work in a shared library.
</p>

<p>
WARNING: The process of building shared libraries is highly
platform dependent. The script buildso is Linux only.
</p>



<h3>Known issues</h3>


<p>
Chances are that the scripting interface in its current for is
leaking memory. This is something that ought to be taken care of
before the scripting interface is ready for general consumption.
Finding and closing potential memory leaks will probably require
a detailed study of the memory management of C++ as well as Python's
<a href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/api/countingRefs.html">
reference counting</a>.
</p>

<p>
The current version of the scripting interface is based on Python 1.5.2
and SWIG 1.1-883. This seems to be the sensible choice because most
Python 1.5.2 is the most common version (although the latest version is
2.1). SWIG 1.3 is available as an unstable alpha release, so it would
probably be unwise to use it at this point. However, the migration to
Python 2 and SWIG 1.3 will probably will become inevitable at some
undetermined point in the future. When this happens, it will probably
be necessary to adjust some of the typemaps in Magnustypes.i. The rest
of the .i files should remain unaffected.
</p>



<h3>To do</h3>


<p>
Steps to complete the scripting interface:
</p>

<ol>
	<li> Find and eliminate potential memory leaks. </li>
	<li> Create .i files for all Magnus classes that may
	be useful for Python programmers. </li>
	<li> Create typemaps for Trichotomy, SetOf... </li>
	<li> Add safety checks to typemaps. </li>
	<li> Create a uniform way of building the shared library
	across all major platforms (SWIG comes with a generic
	Makefile that may be helpful; you can check it out from
	the SWIG library by saying 'swig -co Makefile'). Also,
	it's probably a good idea to compile all Magnus libraries
	with -fpic no matter what.</li>
	<li> Give preliminary versions to sophisticated users
	and tailor the scripting interface to their needs. </li>
</ol>
