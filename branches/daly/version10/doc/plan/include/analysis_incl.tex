\section{The Front End}

%%....................................................................
\subsection{Introduction}

The purpose of the front end is to

\begin{itemize}

\item
allow for the end user to define persistent algebraic objects, and
delete existing ones;

\item
present the currently existing objects in a comprehendible way;

\item
display all information known about a given object;

\item
facilitate the initiation of queries about collections of existing
objects;

\item
provide a means of controlling the strategy and execution of those
queries which are not known to terminate in small time and space.

\end{itemize}


Queries will generate information in the form of new algebraic
objects, along with free-format text, such as
\begin{verbatim}
Let w = a b^-1 a b^-1
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
The word w = v^2, where v = a b^-1
\end{verbatim}
etc. This information is divided into three categories: primary, which
is what was explicitly asked for; secondary, which was not asked for
directly, but is related and likely to be of interest; tertiary, which
is of little interest to most people, but of great interest to some.


The three persistent components of the front end are

\begin{enumerate}

\item
{\em A greeting window.}\\
The function of this window is to anchor global menus, and to display
a greeting which gives the end user a clue as to how to proceed.

\item
{\em A session log.}\\
This is a global transcript of all transactions between the end user
and the system.

\item
{\em A graphical workspace.}\\
This contains icons representing all algebraic objects which
currently exist in the session, and all artificial objects which,
e.g., control an expensive query.

\end{enumerate}


%%....................................................................
\subsection{The Greeting Window}

This anchors the standard {\tt File} and {\tt Edit} menus, and a {\tt
Help} menu.


%%....................................................................
\subsection{The Session Log}

This is a window of editable, scrollable text, comprising a global
transcript of the current session. The text is selectable, so that
algebraic objects defined therein can be copied and pasted into
an object definition dialog.

The types of information which might be written to the log are:

\begin{itemize}

\item
An acknowledgement of the creation of an end user object.

\item
The result of a query, along with any secondary information.

\end{itemize}

A log entry might include the date and time at which it was posted.


%%....................................................................
\subsection{The Workspace}\label{The_Workspace}

The workspace is a scrollable window which contains only icons
representing algebraic and artificial objects. Other graphical
artifacts may be added later, such as arrows indicating relationships
between the objects. The underlying plane over which the window
scrolls expands automatically to make room for new icons.

The workspace supports precisely four end user events:

\begin{enumerate}

\item
{\em Select zero or more objects.}\\
This is supported by the standard mouse protocol.

\item
{\em Drag an object to a new position.}\\
This is supported by the standard mouse protocol.

\item
{\em Display information about the object represented by a given
icon.}\\
This is supported by the standard mouse protocol for de-iconifying an
icon.  It may bring up a top-level window which contains the
information.

\item
{\em Initiate an action on the currently selected objects.}\\
The action may be a group-theoretic query, or a synthetic action such
as creating an object, or deleting the selected ones.  The workspace
has menus, the contents of which change as the selection changes, to
reflect which actions are appropriate on the selection. When the
ordering on the selection is ambiguous, all possibilites are listed.

It is evident from the name of an action whether its purpose is
primarily to return an object. If so, the object goes into the
workspace. If not, any object constructed as a byproduct of the action
is secondary.

\end{enumerate}

Attached to the workspace, possibly at the bottom, is a minilog
containing the last session log entry posted. Its purpose is
reminiscent of the emacs minibuffer, or an X console.

\subsubsection{Artificial Objects}\label{Artificial_Objects}

We currently envisage two classes of artificial objects in the
workspace: those which allow for the initialization and control of
expensive computations, such as the word problem, and report their
current status; and those which enumerate things.


\subsubsubsection{Problem Objects}


A problem object contains standard components:

\begin{itemize}

\item
A description of the group-theoretic parameters of the problem.

\item
A list of component computations, along with a means of specifying
{\em Abstract Resource Credits} (ARCs).  An ARC is a unit of
computation which takes, very roughly, on the order of seconds, rather
than milliseconds or hours. Implementors will strive to break lengthy
computations into natural steps, so that each step can reasonably be
expected to execute within this range of time, but there will be wide
variations.

It is not anticipated for the first release, but parameters for the
component computations may also be specified.

\item
A panel of control buttons, with these behaviors and semantics:

\begin{enumerate}

\item
{\em Start}: Active initially, permanently inactive after starting.
The problem does not {\em run} (consume ARCs) until it is started.

\item
{\em Suspend}: Active only when the problem is running. ARCs may be
changed only before starting, and when the problem is suspended.

\item
{\em Resume}: Active only when the problem is suspended.

\item
{\em Terminate}: Active after the problem starts. Halts all activities
of the problem, and frees any resources used by it directly.

\item
{\em Cancel}: Always active. Reverts any editing, and closes.

\item
{\em Close}: Always active. Enter any editing, and iconify.

\end{enumerate}


\item
A log for all primary, secondary, and tertiary data generated by the
computation.

\end{itemize}



\subsubsubsection{Enumerators}

The examples we have in mind come in two flavors: those which make new
workspace objects one at a time, such as a random small-cancellation
group generator, and those which enumerate large amounts of data which
the end user must be able to browse in some sensible way, such as a
normal closure enumerator.

Generally speaking, there will be many parameters for such
objects. The parameters will be used both for initialization, and for
`changing direction' on-the-fly.

As these are closely related to ideal objects (below), their
properties are still nebulous.

\subsubsection{Algebraic Objects}

The kinds of algebraic objects which can exist in the workspace
are: groups, subgroups, morphisms, elements, and sets of elements or
morphisms, as well as {\em ideal} objects, discussed in the next
section.

The view window for such objects contains certain standard
components: the name of the object, its textual definition
(scrollable), a description of its heritage, and a log which contains
all primary and secondary information discovered about the object.

Subgroups, morphisms, elements, and sets of elements or morphisms are
clearly understood by the system to `belong' to higher level
structures (a word belongs to a group), and possibly to depend on
other objects (a morphism belongs to a hom set, and depends on one or
two groups). The user may perceive this at present only from the
heritage information for each object.

Some end user conventions on words:

\begin{itemize}

\item
Words use 1 based indexing.

\item
Words are not freely reduced on input, but stored as given.

\item
Functions which return words which are understood to be the best
element representative that can be (efficiently) found are free to
alter (e.g., freely reduce) the word. Some functions are understood to
manipulate words syntactically, so they do not reduce the result.

\end{itemize}


%% . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
\subsubsection{Ideal Objects}

By {\em ideal sets} we mean sets which may be infinite, but are at
least recursively enumerable. We try to get a handle on them by
approximating them with finite sets. It is not clear yet whether an
ideal set is comprised of, e.g., all approximations computed so far,
or just the current `best', etc.

We plan to support at least ideal subsets of groups, subgroups, and
sets such as $Hom(G,H)$. They may or may not be endowed with
group-theoretic structure. We don't know yet, but ideal sets may look
to the end user more like ongoing computations rather than static
objects.

We have not as yet identified any properties of ideal sets which would
appear to the end user to be common properties of all ideal sets.


%%--------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Functionality}

The following sections list the desired end user functionality for
various classes of groups. The functionality is in the form of
functions or queries which the end user can invoke.  The inputs are
understood to be workspace objects, except integers, for which the end
user must be prompted.  All functions which return objects are
understood to return workspace objects.

As these are end user queries, there is no need for a unique return
type. For example, the end user can ask whether an element of a group
$G$ is in a term of the lower central series for $G$. If the answer is
yes, the user gets secondary information: in this case, the term of
the series to which the element belongs.

There is an important paradigm for representing computations which are
either lengthy or possibly non-terminating. We associate with the
computation a persistent workspace object, through which the end user
can: allocate ARCs to, guide the strategy of, monitor the progress of,
and receive results from, the computation. The computation returns a
result in the usual sense only when it can answer the question or
produce the desired object; otherwise, it consumes all of its
allocated ARCs, and becomes idle until given more ARCs or explicitly
terminated (see \S\ref{Artificial_Objects}).

\subsection{The Front End}\update{08/08/95}

Some possible additional features of the front have been suggested:

\begin{itemize}

\item
The more sophisticated end users will need a way to navigate among the
extant computations, and add new ones below the top level. Figures~\ref{WPview}
and \ref{NQview} suggest some possibilities.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\epsfbox{ps/WPview.ps}
\caption{A toplevel problem manager view.}\label{WPview}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\epsfbox{ps/NQview.ps}
\caption{A submanager view: nilpotent quotients.}\label{NQview}
\end{figure}

\item
An object view might display two logs, to keep tertiary output
separate from primary and secondary.

\item
It can be difficult to tell what functionality is available without
entering every possible kind of object, and looking at the menus. We
need an overall synopsis.

\item
A definition dialog might allow toplevel name substitution, e.g.,
words which are already in the workspace could be entered by name as
relators for a group.

\item
The end user must be able to force a computation which is not actually
needed (because a solution already exists by other means). Such
`redundant' computations could be systematically used to cross-check
results.

\item
We need an (optional) syntax for naming subgroup generators, e.g.,
{\tt \{~a~=~[x,y],~b~=~z~y~x~\}}

\end{itemize}
