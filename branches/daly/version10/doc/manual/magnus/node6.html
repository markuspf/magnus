Comments</A>
</H2>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Comment each data member and method of a class, in the header file.
Say what it is used for or what it does. Detailed information which is
not of interest to the user of the class goes in the source file or
the reference manual.
</LI>
<LI>Comment your source code so that those with a sufficient background in
infinite group theory and C++ can understand it as though they wrote
it.
</LI>
<LI>Some comments are not explanatory, but are meant to flag lines which are
questionable, or are `to do' reminders, etc. Mark these with a comment
containing `@' followed by your initials. That way we know who wrote
it, and no one has to sift through all comments to find problems; they
can be <TT>grep</TT>-ed.

<P>
Do not use @-marked comments purely for traceability, e.g., to mark
code you've added and are sure of. Those comments belong in the
revision history.

<P>
When you alter code written by someone else, you can address your
comments on the change to that person with, e.g., <TT>@rn:@stc</TT>.
