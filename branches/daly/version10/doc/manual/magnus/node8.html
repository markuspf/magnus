<P>
Here you discuss what other implementers need and want to know about
your code in order to use it, without necessarily understanding its
inner workings.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The worst possible documentation to create for an object-oriented
system is a stand-alone description of the semantics of each method on
a class-by-class basis. This approach tends to generate a great deal
of useless documentation that no one reads or trusts, and fails to
document the more important architectural issues that transcend
individual classes, namely, the collaborations among classes and
objects. It is far better to document these higher-level structures,
which can be expressed in diagrams of the notation but have no direct
linguistic expression in the programming language, and then refer
developers to the interfaces of certain important classes for tactical
details.

Thus you might give

<P>

<UL>
<LI>A description of the public classes (those intended for
		further use) and their features (such as for instance
		special efficiency and memory considerations);
</LI>
<LI>Important parts of the public class interfaces.
</LI>
<LI>Diagrams of derivation and owns-uses relationships among
        classes.
	
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Booch diagrams may be appropriate for the last. There is a simple
example in &#167;<A HREF="#user_classes">1.7</A>; several others are in the reference
manual. Here is a brief list of the notation:
