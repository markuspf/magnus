Testing Procedures</A>
</H1>

<P>
This section describes the testing procedures for <SMALL>MAGNUS</SMALL>.
Roughly, one may distinguish two levels of tests.

<P>

<UL>
<LI>General `external' tests, which test the behaviour
of the system or its components
with respect to their external calling interfaces, viz.&nbsp;for classes
their public methods.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Specific low-level tests, which may be more specialised in their
way of verifying the internal functioning of (functions of) the
system. For instance, if a <TT>SetOf</TT> class constructs hash tables,
the implementer may desire or need to devise specific tests which
verify the internal layout of the tables.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The external tests (with as the need arises their associated test data
sets) are mandatory, as these are necessary to know whether the system
functions at all. Low level tests are a function of their necessity in
the course of implementation and not an end in themselves. For these, the 
guiding principle is to write them only as need dictates, for instance
when debugging; but if writing some, then to keep these for possible
reuse.

<P>
The aim is to 

<P>

<UL>
<LI>build up a set of tests for <SMALL>MAGNUS</SMALL> concurrently
to the development of the system;

<P>
</LI>
<LI>organise this set as a reusable library of standard tests for
the system.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The reasons are the obvious:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Tests are onerous to devise and implement;

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Better results are obtained by testing from the beginning onwards;

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Tests need not be rebuilt from scratch to localise later bugs;

<P>
</LI>
</UL>
