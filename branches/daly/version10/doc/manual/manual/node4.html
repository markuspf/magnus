Introduction</A>
</H2>

<P>
The back end is comprised of C++ classes, and global functions which
act on objects in these classes.

<P>
We divide the classes into three conceptual types: user, utility, and
private.

<P>

User classes wrap pointers to object representations
(&#167;<A HREF="node5.html#obj_reps">3.1.1.1</A>). They are intended as high-level constructs with
fixed interfaces and intuitive semantics.  As objects in such classes
occupy only as much memory as a pointer, they can be efficiently
copied and assigned.  The typical use of objects in a user class is
through automatic variables and class data members. Only in
extraordinary circumstances would one have a pointer to such an
object; the object itself takes no more space, and construction,
assignment, and destruction are handled automatically.

<P>
<BR>
<BR>
Utility classes are those which do useful, general things, but which
would not reasonably use wrapped object representations.  For example,
a <TT>Cell</TT> class might have two data members: an object of a user
class and a pointer to a <TT>Cell</TT>; this could be used for
externally linked lists. To be reusable, utility class interfaces and
semantics are fixed.

<P>
<BR>
<BR>
Private classes are those which the implementer uses to hide data
representations or perform other hidden tasks. As they are not
intended to be reusable, their interfaces and functionality are
subject to change without notice.
