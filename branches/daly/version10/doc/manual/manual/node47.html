Geometry Management</A>
</H2>

<P>
In almost all of the examples in Ousterhout's book, widget paths are
cluttered by the demands of the packer. For example, in order to
ensure that a button is drawn correctly in a window, you might make an
enclosing frame which serves no purpose other than to manage the
geometry of the button. Thus:

<P>
<PRE>
  frame .d9.frame6
  button .d9.frame6.ok -text OK; button .d9.frame6.cancel -text Cancel
  pack .d9.frame6.ok .d9.frame6.cancel -side left
  pack .d9.frame6 -side top
</PRE>

<P>
It is certainly tedious to build all of these frames and pack the
widgets into them `by hand'. But much worse is the fact that sometimes
you can not avoid hard-wiring a widget path in a procedure other than
the one which made the widget; the procedure might not even be in the
same file.  This means that whenever you change the geometry of a
window, you must track down all references to its widgets and change
them too.

<P>
But there is a simple solution. Every widget except <TT>.</TT> has a <EM>parent</EM>, and, if it is packed, a <EM>master</EM> which manages its
geometry. These need not be the same. Above, <TT>.d9.frame6</TT> is both
the parent and master of <TT>ok</TT>, but we can make <TT>.d9</TT> the
parent of <TT>ok</TT> instead, and pack <TT>.d9.ok</TT> in <TT>.d9.frame6</TT>.
That way, all (or at least the `exported') widgets have a canonical
path, while allowing transparent changes to their masters. The above
example becomes:

<P>
<PRE>
  frame .d9.frame6
  button .d9.ok -text OK; button .d9.cancel -text Cancel
  pack .d9.ok .d9.cancel -side left -in .d9.frame6
  pack .d9.frame6 -side top
</PRE>
