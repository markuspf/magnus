Files and Banners</A>
</H2>

<P>
The program source is broken into files <TT>*.[hC]</TT>, generally
containing the implementation of a single class, with possibly in
addition closely related local servant classes.

<P>
Each file starts with a banner, containing the following mandatory
parts: revision identification and number, brief description of the
contents, principal author, status, and history of implementation and
modifications with authors. Blanks are in 
<TT>magnus/doc/templates/Blank.[Ch]</TT>.

<P>
Additionally, you may want to add, according to the circumstances,
other entries such as literature references, testing report summary,
implementation notes, next implementation steps, and bugs (suspected
and known).

<P>
