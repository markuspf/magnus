Naming conventions</A>
</H2>

<P>
Public identifiers should be as self-documenting as possible.  This is a
matter of taste and judgement: we considered <TT>FPGroup</TT> to be too
terse, writing <TT>FinitelyPresentedGroup</TT> instead, but this made
source lines too long to read.

<P>
Our spelling conventions for <EM>public</EM> identifiers are:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Type and class names start with upper case.
</LI>
<LI>Names of constants are in all capitals.
</LI>
<LI>Member and method names start with lower case, but significant subwords
start with upper case. No underscores.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Local identifiers need not be as descriptive as public ones, but
should still convey their meaning and use.
