\end{itemize}
Note: this group is isomorphic to the infinite cyclic group.

\item Object (Abelian groups)

$G=\left<a,b; Bab=ab, Aba=ab \right>$.
\begin{itemize}


\item Is $G$ trivial? E:y  R:n 

\item Is $G$ finite? E: Yes R: no 

\item Is $G$ free-abelian E: No R: y

\item Is $G$ automatic? E:y R:y  (all abelian gps are automatic)

\item Is $G$ hyperbolic? E:y  R:y (all abelian groups are hyperbolic)
\end{itemize}
\item Object (Free nilpotent groups)

$G=\left<x,y \right>$, class 2. 

\begin{itemize}

\item Compute the 1st term of the lower central series of $G:$ 

E: $gp(x,y)$  R: $gp(x,y).$ 

\item Compute the 2nd term of the lower central series of $G:$

E: $gp([y,x])$ R:$gp([y,x]).$

\item Compute the 3rd term of the lower central series of $G:$

E: The trivial group, R: No answer at all 

\item Compute the Hirsch number of $G:$

E: 3, R:3.

\item Compute a basis for $G$:

E: $ \{x,y, [y,x]  \}$, R: $\{ x,y, [y,x]  \}$

\end{itemize}

\item Object (Free nilpotent groups)

$G=\left<x,y \right>$, class 4. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Compute the 1st term of the lower central series of $G:$ 



E: $gp(x,y)$  R: $gp(x,y).$ 

\item Compute the 2nd term of the lower central series of $G:$

E: $gp \left([y,x], [y,x,y], [y,x,x], [y,x,y,y], [y,x,x,y], [y,x,x,x] \right)$ 

Use the notation: $x^{-1}=X$ and $y^{-1}=Y$:

R: \begin{eqnarray*}
gp (YXyx, 
XYXy x^2, 
Y^{2} X^{2} y^2 x, 
Y^{2}Xy^2x,
X^{2}YXyx, \\
XYXy x^2, 
Y^{2}Xy^2 x,
X^{2}YXy x^3,
X^{2}Yx y^2 x,
Y^{3} X y^3 x ) \end{eqnarray*}


Note: the reason that the expected answer is as above is that it is obtained from basic commutators on $\{x,y\}$ of weights 2 and higher. The answer Magnus gives may also be correct, but it is less economical.

\item Compute the 3rd term of the lower central series of $G:$

E: $gp\left([y,x,y],[y,x,x],[y,x,y,y],[y,x,x,y],[y,x,x,x]\right)$

R: $gp \left(XyXyXYXyx^2, XYxYXyxy, X^2Y^2x,yXY,Xy x^3, XY^2Xyx^2y,XYxY^2Xyxy^2 \right).$

Same comment as in previous item. 

\item Compute the Hirsch number of $G:$

E: 8 , R: 8.

\item Compute a basis for $G$:

E: $\{ x,y, [y,x],[y,x,y],[y,x,x],[y,x,y,y],[y,x,x,y],[y,x,x,x] \}$, 

E: $\{ x,y, [y,x],[y,x,y],[y,x,x],[y,x,y,y],[y,x,x,y],[y,x,x,x]. \}$

\[T=\left<x,y ; [y,x,y,y]^3 [y,x,x,y] [y,x,x,x]^2\right>.\]
